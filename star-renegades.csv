This game has great potential but suffers from being arbitrarily difficult in some areas (the last stage is particularly frustrating) and overly repetitive in others. The story is non-existent aside from a couple cutscenes, which is really unfortunate.

I enjoyed the turn-based fighting system and the ability to manipulate enemies' positions on the initiative order. The pixel art and animations are also pretty cool. However, these are the highlights in a game of otherwise uninspiring systems.

87122016,english,"Preface: I literally no-lifed this game for 4 days straight

[b] PROS [/b]
-Beautiful pixel art: The game makes it visually pleasing to watch all of the cool effects, especially the shadows adding a cool depth effect.
-Good combat system: I might be overrating this as this is my first turn based game outside of Pokemon but it feels amazing when you perfectly line up your moves, like chess.
-Music: It may like basic 8 bit music, but it fits the atmosphere of the game very well and hasn't sounded dull at all in my 6 (as of now) 4 hour long playthroughs.

[b] CONS[/b]
-Dialogue: I may be a story hog but after beating the game twice, the dialogue started to rub on my nerves. Seeing ""MOTHER SAVE ME"" for the 20th time became comical.
-Fast Forward Effect: The weird screen compress/static effect is an eye strainer, maybe add in a reduced motion one for the people who could be sensitive to this?
-Bugs: I got a game breaking bug on my 5th playthrough where when I opened steam overlay during the load screen after choosing difficulty, the game froze, unfroze but I had no characters and the enemies would infinitely shoot at nothing. Restarting the game didn't fix anything so I had to abandon the run. At least it happened at the start and not the end D:

[b] NEUTRAL [/b]
-Combos: Some are good, others are meh which makes you prioritize certain relationships giving you less choice (unless you want a meh combo)
-Long playthroughs: It took me about 5 hours my first time, then down to 3 on easy and now 4 on average. If you have a whole day to spare you can grind it out, but if you are someone with only an hour a day or so it will take you a while to beat a run. Personally I don't mind even though I came from playing Hades which is usually sub 30 min for a run.

Overall 8/10, I bought it on sale for $20 but at full price I would buy it too. Its a fun game when you want a break from all of the multiplayer games.",1613857226,1613857272,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,76561198165460436,49,4,1798,1798,1401,1614303228,,

87094329,english,"Star Renegades is a well-crafted and engaging entry into the ""roguelite rpg"" genre that makes good use of borrowed ideas while also shining on its own innovations.

Pros:
 - The combat system is excellent. Turn based games often have mechanics for changing turn order, but Renegades does an amazing job of making turn order and enemy management engaging and satisfying to interact with.
 - This game is pretty as heck, but I'm a sucker for good pixel art and that might not be to your taste. Characters are visually striking and very distinct from one another, behemoths look powerful and unique, even the enemy visual variety is noteworthy.
 - The animations are pretty crisp and clear, it's not often that you can't tell what someone is doing when they perform a move. As a sidenote, good sound design mixed with appropriately applied screen shake makes big hits feel great.
 - Your favorite character won't always be available for every run, and half your team is unpredictable, which forces a lot of experimentation and leads to really mastering the battle system and its nuances when your go-to strategy isn't possible. Smart ways to push players out of their comfort zones is always welcome.
 - Items feel strong and impactful, and the game lets you tool a bit with how often you see some, either more or less, which is nice when you are constantly expanding the item pool and want to control your odds a bit.

Cons:
 - Dialogue variety is weak. Some of the heart dialogues between characters are really amusing, and I overall dig the ""dark humour during end of the world"" approach most of them have, but more lines could really make the characters feel more alive. As it stands it feels more like an afterthought, despite being tied to one of the core party mechanics.
 - I absolutely love the progeny system, but I think it would feel better for players if they could use the new classes unlocked through it right away. It's really disappointing to unlock one and not have enough points to then buy it and use it. Buying class variants is fine the way it is though.
 - This game needs more planets and bosses. They're working on this, and I'm more than happy to be patient, but it definitely needs some enhanced variety to keep runs from feeling same-y once you get a groove going.
 - This is more a comment on the nature of roguelites, but I feel it strongly here when I hit my apex of strength pretty much just in time for the final boss and then the run is over. You don't get much time to really flex any end game power your party gets, since the last ""planet"" is over so fast.
 
The strengths of this game easily overshadow its faults for me, especially knowing that they are still adding free content, and I got easily sucked into this game's combat mechanics and tactical decision making. Addressing the cons is really just icing the cake, since the core of this game feels so good to me to interact with.

82838934,russian,"Я не рекомендую эту игру. сама игра интересная, все можете почитать в моем старом отзыве ниже. НО отношение разработчиков ужасно. C каждым патчем глюков, багов, называйте как угодно, появляется больше чем исправляется. Это ужасно: играть вроде бы можно, но тут способность неправильно по времени работает, там отображается не то, что должно быть на самом деле, а вот в один прекрасный момент ты можешь ходить по всей карте и брать любые вещи и так далее. И это в игре где все на этих способностях завязано и на временной шкале, и где каждая вещь это серьезное усиление. И когда играешь на высоких уровнях сложности как никогда важно чтобы все это работало правильно.
Это как дешевые вещи из китая. вроде работают то так криво что оно тебе и не надо. Этой игре нужен напильник, кувалда и много чего еще, а разработчикам совесть. Возможно со временем игра станет нормальной и доработанной, но на данный момент это не так. и я не уверен, что это изменится.

вот старый отзыв:
Привет, игра интересная. графика на любителя, я не люблю пиксель арт, но тут мне понравилось. если откинуть оформление отдаленно напоминает rencounter.
+плюсы:
Интересная боевка, интересные навыки.
юмор и реплики героев. вменяемый сюжет, мне зашло графическое оформление.
шрифты, иконки состояний и подобное выполнены в нормальной графике, так что глаза ломать не придется. удобный интерфейс. подробное обучение.
реиграбельность и увеличение сложности.
видно что разработчики трудятся, выходят новые обновы и исправляются ошибки
баг репорты отправлять относительно удобно и на них быстро реагируют.

-минусы:
разработчики выкатывают обновы не оттестировав их. так что будьте готовы словить фатальные баги и глюки, играя в последнюю версию. Конечно всегда можно поставить предыдущую версию игры через свойства- бета версии (на данный момент стабильная 1,1,0,9) и избежать этих проблем. Но само отношение непрятно: я купил игру чтобы играть, а не быть бета тестером.
- местами пикселизация не очень приятна, к примеру герои на карте и на иконках в меню отряда настолько мелкие и условные, что понять какой из этих кучек пикселей твой стрелок, а какой танк ну очень сложно. в целом не мешает.
- анимешность некоторых моментов. ушастый робот-гид-тамагочи с дикими эмодзи - все это на любителя.

Как итог:
мне игра понравилась. купил за полную стоимость когда увидел, что они выкатили обновление. к сожалению последняя версия нестабильная поэтому играю в предыдущую жду когда допилят.

1. 겜 재밌음 한 회차가 서너시간쯤 잡아먹는데 그게 금새 지나가는 타임머신임

2. 전투가 턴마다 제시되는 적들 공격을 아군 스킬로 밀건 밀고 막을건 막으면서 딜해가는 방식인데, 확 밀어서 다음턴까지 날려버릴 수 있지만 제약이 있어서 밀기만 하다가는 중요할때 못밀고 개쳐맞는 경우도 있어 나름 깊다

3. 운빨이 작용할만한 부분은 정예몹 내성 / 맵 배치 / 아이템 드랍 / 추가 인원 정도고 전투 시작하면 운빨이 없는 것도 좋다
내성 부분은 탱/딜/서폿으로 팀 꾸렸는데 첫행성에 정예몹이 내 딜러를 저격한듯한 내성 들고오면 짱날 수 있지만 정예몹을 꼭 다 잡아야 하는건 아니라서 피하는 동선을 짜면 해결되니 큰 문제는 아닐 것
추가 인원은 특성 찍으면 세마리 아니면 두마리중 하나 골라서 충원하는데 조졌다 싶게 나온 적은 없었음

4. 쉴드 시스템이 참 좋은데 전투가 시작되면 쉴드가 차있는 상태로 시작해서 적당히 맞아도 체력은 깎이지 않는다. 체력이 눈꼽만큼만 달아도 치명적이던 다른 턴제 로그라이크 겜들에서 한대도 안맞으려 몸 비틀어대던걸 생각해보면 쉴드 깎이고 채우고 하면서 치고박는 전투가 이뤄지는게 참 보기에 꽤 좋은 편

ระบบ Combat ทำออกมาได้สนุก การวาง Action ในแต่ละครั้งของ Timeline ต้องคิดให้ดี ศัตรูสามารถส่วนกลับรุนแรงได้ถ้า ถ้าวางแผนผิด
การขัดศัตรูในเกมนี้สำคัญมากแต่ก็ไม่สามารถทำได้ทุก Timeline

The biggest weakness of the game being the story by far. Every character has to crack an awful one-liner or be a caricature. None of your characters have any depth or personality beyond being cardboard cutouts used in attempt to sell a joke, which is a shame because the world and art design is almost begging for something a bit more serious. Levity is good, but when every character's a comedian it turns the world into a joke.

Other than that, the gameplay is solid if not a bit strict, something that could be fixed with some balance tweaks and support for other ways of building your team. If you can look past the story and some of the rough edges you'll have a fun time.

86431518,english,"I've gone back and forth on whether to hit the thumbs up or down on this for a while. I think the labor of love the devs have put into it tips me over the edge on giving it credit where credit is due for creating a unique experience and something with a lot of potential. On paper, this game looks extremely up my alley. A retro roguelike with JRPG elements? Sign me up. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short in both areas for me personally, and some elements from each design inspiration end up being kind of antithetical to one another. Some of the main reasons I love roguelikes as a genre are the ability to earn yourself a bit of a theoretical victory lap (the part in the last few stages of the game where you've assembled a cohesive and powerful synergy and get to feel overpowered for a bit before you go and fight the final boss) when you do well in a run , making you feel like you've earned it, and the overall digestibility of each run. Generally, roguelike runs have respect for your time and a successful run will take about or less than an hour. This game doesn't really have either of those things. An average victory in Star Renegades clocks in over 3 hours. In addition to this being way too long imo, it makes losing a run feel all the more brutal. Get 2 hours in and die to the third behemoth? It feels a lot worse than other roguelikes. If you have limited playtime, you probably won't feel like starting another run. This isn't just due to the turn-based combat and planning your moves. The game generally doesn't feel like it respects your time. There's lengthy cutscenes and combat animations (which you can fast forward through, but you have to hold a button, there's no option to turn up gamespeed by default and in some of the later fights you have a pan in and then multiple enemies doing animations one at a time at the start of the fight, exacerbated further at entropy 4&5 where there are more enemies), the elites popping up chat windows when you spawn into a planet or kill another elite that can't really be skipped through very quickly, and the overall exploration of planets. I wish they would have chosen a top down or grid system that moved with a selection and button press like Slay The Spire, etc. I mean I guess moving around the planets like it's a super nintendo era game is a design choice that I could respect if it didn't pad out the runtime of an already long game in a genre that's supposed to be not that. In my first run, I ran into a wall against an elite that I just couldn't kill. He would regen health constantly, and regenerate shields and armor every few turns. He wasn't able to kill my units either, but I just couldn't blitz through his full defensive recharging. I sat there for half an hour trying to grind through the tediousness hoping the devs had put in some way to make the encounter more interactive at some point before abandoning that run. That sums up a lot of experiences with this game pretty well. And then after you've beaten the third behemoth and most likely hit your peak power, there's only three fights until the final boss. For a 3+ hour run, 10-20 minutes tops of a victory lap feels like a slap in the face.
As far as the RPG inspiration, this game suffers immensely by not having a skill tree system. I understand that with the genre mix, they probably wanted to stay away from consistent strategies that function the same way everytime, so they tied what might be perks to gear you find randomly instead and the progeny system (basically alternate loadout/skillsets you can unlock for your characters). However, I think the game would be far more interesting if you had some input on what happens when you level up. Even if it was just say, level 6 you get to pick a passive to reinforce your character's playstyle a bit more and level 10, you get to choose which ability gets it's second form, it'd be a lot more gratifying and also probably increase the roster of viable characters substantially. Which is another huge problem. While only a few characters are unviable on the base difficulty, that rapidly changes as you up the difficulty, especially with tanks and single target characters (for perspective, I think the only difficulty I haven't beaten is entropy 5, the last difficulty). And some characters are just objectively worse versions of others. For example, there is absolutely no reason to pick Marksman ever again once you've unlocked Spectre (outside of spectre getting abducted or maybe running both, but I can't fathom why you would want to do that). She does similar levels of high damage, but she has an AOE to boot (which is king on higher difficulties), and an ability to cloak to get around stagger-proof targets or let herself drop aggro. Again, this is where a perk or tree system could give a bit of leverage to make the characters feel more distinct.
All of this to say, I have some major reservations about recommending this game, but I recommend it nonetheless, especially if you aren't turned off by my perspective on it's flaws. I really want to love this game. It's a unique experience with some satisfying moments when you do get a cohesive strategy to come together and I think it has a lot of potential to improve. They recently have made several content updates with new dungeons/areas and a new character, so I will probably revisit this game at some point once the devs have had time to expand on the concept a bit more.",1613090167,1613090167,True,2,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False,76561198026330882,636,12,2902,0,2902,1611799644,,

86228892,english,"With fantastic art and music paired with cringe-inducing writing, Star Renegades is a combat-focused party-based RPG that is massively hindered by its deterministic/reactive battle system. Rather than having it enhance typical RPG battle dynamics, instead it shoehorns everything into that one game mechanic.

Because of that, optimal strategy most of the time boils down to using the slowest action you can get away with while still getting a critical off plus trying to break the enemy into not taking an action - meaning that the novelty reaction system brings the entire game down with it rather than enhance the traditional RPG gameplay and adding a new strategic layer to it.

Compare that to say, Heroes of Might and Magic V where they added a combat timeline that enhanced the traditional gameplay of the series but didn't massively shoehorn everything else into ""how does this action affect the timeline"". Star Renegades, on the other hand manages to throw away the baby with the bath water. It's novelty over established tradition in the worst possible shape it can take.

Also, keyboard controls are clunky and subpar while information delivery is absolutely terrible despite the screen being jam-packed with data. It's not easy to understand what an action does or what an enemy is even when you take the trouble to go to the inspect modes and read their data-sheets carefully. Even something as trivial as their HP bars are hard to spot on at a glance.

Star Renegades feels like what happens when an incredibly talented team of artists, musicians and game designers come out with when they try to go ""all out"" on their first project (or second, as the case may be) rather than try to start from humble beginnings and work their way up instead - a product that while beautiful to look at and listen to, is a jumble of disconnected ideas with zero polish or soul to it, while brandishing its ambition proudly in its sleeve. Seems like it could have been a much better, polished game if scaled down but instead turns out to be a hugely complex and sprawling amount of wasted potential.",1612819186,1612819852,False,4,0,0.42106512188911438,1,True,False,False,76561198321740054,147,167,28,0,28,1612818320,1613144659.0,"Hello, we are extremely sorry you feel this way!

-Some of the best pixel art in a video game I've seen since Duelyst.
-The battles are intense, thoughtful, and exciting. Truly the highlight of the game.
-The classes all feel unique, mixing and matching them is extremely satisfying.

Cons:
-Runs are pretty long. I think mine are about 4-6 hours on average. A lot of this is because the battles are so intense and each turn is a puzzle to figure out. There's almost always a solution, too, if you set up your team properly, but it also makes runs longer than other games.
-Nemesis system is pointless and does almost nothing.
-Progeny system is bloated and you won't care about 95% of them.
-Some skill interactions are really unclear. I still haven't really figured out how guard stacking works, or if it even does. There needs to be a sandbox mode to test out interactions.

Still a really satisfying game and 100% worth the price.",1612792862,1612800454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005712493,32,6,1829,0,1489,1613241324,,
86207821,russian,"Залипательная тактика с пошаговыми боями. Из похожих игр, в которые я играл, можно назвать Battlechasers: Nightwar и серия Epic Battle Fantasy. Боевая система похожа на многие классические JRPG, но намного вдумчивее и глубже.

Из недостатков игры можно отметить:

-Неудобные переходы по секторам на карте, иногда сложно попасть в нужную точку, чтобы сработал переход.

- Зачем-то заставляют бэктречить по карте, чтобы собрать ресурсы с уже пройденных секторов. Могли бы и просто сообщить –мол нате вам всякого. Смысл бы не изменился.

-В бою спрайты загораживают друг-друга, а паутина направлений атак сливается в кашу. Не очень интуитивный менеджмент снаряги, далеко не сразу нашёл, где можно экипировать отложенные вещи. 

-Сам интерфейс во время сражений перегружен, иногда закрывает треть экрана, вне боя же, наоборот, его лаконичность мешает быстро сделать рутинные операции.
-Периодические мелкие баги.

-Ближе к концу забега сражения становятся затянутыми. 

Ну а играть в игру стоит ради разнообразия ситуаций- всё таки перед нами роуглайт с генерящимися уровнями и врагами. В игре юморные диалоги, дельная система взаимоотношений, построенная на своеобразной карточной механике. Пиксельная стилистика на любителя, но мне понравилось как тут сочетаются параллакс, трёхмерное окружение и спрайтовые герои. Правда портреты персонажей иногда странно двигаются в анимациях.


Пока прошёл игру один раз, на второй заход идти не очень хочется, ибо один ран занимает много времени, а если в один присест не закончить, то через пару дней я забуду чего тут у меня со снарягой и какой был план прокачки.

游戏一大不合理的设计是流程过长（一场战役6h+）又缺乏退出机制。我好几次都是在倒数第二或是最后一个场景失误导致游戏结束，感觉浪费了几个小时却毫无收获。另外，选择角色不当或者前期失误会极大的降低后期胜利的可能性，在这种情况下玩家应该可以选择阶段性胜利然后再开一局。流程过长还导致了单局试错成本极高，以至于鼓励玩家依赖上次胜利的途径操作而不是探索新的角色搭配和武器选择。",1612629888,1612629905,True,1,0,0.508599519729614258,0,True,False,False,76561198107862673,112,8,5043,0,5043,1612282532,,

Alors pourquoi mettre un avis négatif ?

Car il se qualifie de rogue-like, je l'ai acheté en ce sens et il n'est pas du tout mais alors pas du tout rogue-like.

J'ai fini le jeu au premier RUN, un run dure environ 8h.
On est sensé devenir plus fort après chaque run hors ce n'est pas le cas.
On débloque seulement des nouveaux persos qui ont autant d'importance que ce qu'on a deja.

Et encore, certains personnage sont obligatoire, comme le robot qui tape avec ses points qui est le seul vrai healer du jeu.

De même que le saboteur est obligatoire pour le controle des ennemis.
De même que le sniper pour faire un max de degat si on veut pas que le combat dure 3 fois plus longtemps.

Donc là on se retrouve deja avec 3 personnages obligatoire ce qui laisse peu de marge pour jouer avec les compos.

Ensuite on peut améliorer des armes mais on doit en choisir qu'une seule pour qu'on commence avec sachant qu'on trouvera mieux vers la fin...
Donc là aussi le coté rogue-like on y passera...

Ha on peut améliorer notre drone ou plutot changer son mode qui apportera un bonus dans le jeu, comme ramasser plus de sous, ou avoir plusieurs de choix de persos lors des recrutement à la fin d'un niveau.

Et c'est tout !!

Lors d'un run les évolutions des personnages (ils gagnent des niveaux au fil des combats) est là aussi assez modeste ce qui fait qu'après deux run on ressent deja de la lassitude... en effet il n'y a pas d'abre de talent ou de choix de competence histoire d'avoir des builds différents...

La seule chose que j'ai aimé dans le jeu est la gestion du combat, ULTRA tactique, il faut à chaque round longuement réfléchir à la meilleur approche pour en sortir vainqueur et sans trop bobo ce qui rallonge considérablement la durée des runs.

Mais voila, cela ne suffit pas pour empecher cette lassitude, le manque de dynamisme et d'évolution fait qu'au bout de 2 run (et une troisieme en cours) on se retrouve deja lassé du jeu...

If you've played either Bravely Default or any other modernized take on the traditional JRPG formula like Octopath Traveler, you'll be right at home with Star Renegades. The primary difference is that combat is ""deterministic"", per the game's description, which is to say that enemies telegraph their precise moves, damage, and turn order in advance. Other than that, the gameplay doesn't break too much new ground: Fast-forwarding, ""breaking"" enemies (delaying their turn), and charged / special actions all feature prominently.  That accounts for the sparse/passive roguelite elements here, as well. If you go in expecting Binding of Isaac, you'll be sorely disappointed. There's little build diversity, and getting a good item is more a matter of bigger numbers than differentiated tactics. 

I'm mostly writing this review because of the homogeneity of the negative reviews: In my time with it thus far, I have yet to encounter any bugs or apparent glitches at all.

이 게임에서 중요하다고 생각되는 것은 다음과 같이 세가지다.
1) 밀어내기를 통한 치명타 효과를 최대한 보는 것 + 격파로 시간벌기
2) 전투가 끝나면 회복되는 베리어는 깎여도 되지만 회복되지 않는 체력은 최대한 안깎이기 (야영에서 체력을 회복하는 카드는 코스트가 대체로 낮아서 한명만 집중해서 맞고, 나머진 폭딜넣어도 된다)
3) 기절, 감시와 응수사격같은 상대의 특정행동 봉쇄와 같이 상대의 기술을 무력화 시키는 능력

당연하겠지만 보스전 특성상 피통 베리어통이 빵빵하고 장갑도 높아서 장기적인 싸움이 될 수 밖에 없기에, >>>>>유지력<<<<<과 상대 기술 봉쇄가 핵심이다. 다행히도 로그라이크 치고는 템이나 몹과 같은 변수로 인해 난이도가 크게 변동하지는 않고 난이도도 어렵지 않은 편이라, 해당 분야에 입문하는 사람도 큰 부담을 느끼지 않고 재밌게 할 수 있으리라 생각한다.

이하는 짤막한 Tip.
1) 스테이지를 시작하기 전에 맵을 둘러보면서 영원교 교단이나 공장같은 특수 이벤트용 몬스터가 어디 있는지 확인한다. 걔네들을 잡고 해당 던전에 들어가는 지역을 뚫어서, 추가적인 파밍을 할 수 있도록 하자.
2) 필자는 개인적으로 보호막을 추가 하는 것을 좋아한다. 핵심적으로 >>>유지력이 증가<<<하는 것은 물론이고, 물몸인 딜러 및 지원가들의 끔살 방지나 집중적으로 공격받을 탱커를 더 튼튼하게 만드는 것도 좋은 선택이다. 
3) 크레딧은 상자보다는 AA총이나 개틀링이 있는 지역의 몹과 싸워서 DNA와 함께 수금하는 것이 더 좋다고 생각한다.
4) 아이템은 든든한 국밥 탱커템 ""거상""을 무조건 뚫어놓자. 추가 베리어량도 좋고, 베리어 재생도 쏠쏠해서 필자는 확률까지 올려뒀다. 딜링템은 본인의 취향껏 선택하면 된다. (딜템도 국밥템이 있다면 공유부탁드립니다 ㅎㅎ)

It is buggy at times, I had an issue where after beating a boss, the game softlocked, stopping me from progressing until I quite and relaunched the game. From what I hear, these bugs do happen, but generally simply exiting the game and relaunching it fixes the issue, but it is something to bear in mind before picking it up.

Also, this game is hard. You will get punished for making mistakes and carefully planning each move and deciding what path to take to get the best use out of your limited movement while deciding if certain combat is worth it for the potential rewards vs the damage your characters might take is important. Being too reckless can put you in a pretty bad position, but being too cautious and not getting enough equipment or level ups will equally be bad.

One of my favourite mechanics is the relationship mechanic, effectively allowing you to craft your own synergies between characters. You can affect the relationships between characters to grow their bonds, unlocking passive buffs and powerful team attacks that can make all the difference in a tight spot. It also adds some neat little dialogue that helps flesh out the characters and add some personality to them.

The art style is really nice, there's plenty of colour and it is generally just really well done, and the music is really good too. It's obvious that a lot of hard work went into the art of the game, and it's very impressive.

I think my biggest issue with the game is the music. Not that it isn't good. It just gets very old very fast when you keep replaying planets. I really wish they had more tracks or they kept changing them randomly. I know it's an indie studio which is why I decided to rebuy it so many times. I really want to see Star Renegades 2 now. That would probably be my biggest issue with the game.

Other than that. The combat is old school turn RPG battle system. You can find random items to equip your party. All the characters feel fresh and not repeats of either other. I normally get attached to my favorite party members. But everyone has their strengths and weakness and it's fun making different teams and evolving my strategy. 

Combat has a lot of depth. Crits aren't just random ""I hope and pray it RNG crits for me or I'm boned"" like other RPGs. If you attack before the enemy is able to do theirs, then you get a crit. You can also attack them with staggers to delay or fully prevent them from taking a turn. This way your whole party can all get max damage. They have a Shield, Armor, Health system. This gives the combat even more depth by making you choose what you want to priorities at the moment. They also show you want will/won't kill your party member in that given turn. Think of it like Xenoblade Chronicles by Nintendo. 

You always hear people say ""If you lose, it's your fault"" and I don't always agree with that mindset and think it's overused. While I wouldn't say 100% of the time that is true for this game. Mainly because RNG can always really screw you from time to time. I think that's with anything in life. But there were moments where I was like ""I have no idea how I'm going to manage this"" and after a lot of thinking and looking at every option I had. I was able to come out on top and make it work. It's a really great feeling. I know the game feels very punishing with your first few playthroughs. But the more you learn the systems and unlock more Renegades. The game opens up and is a lot of fun. I can't wait to unlock everything again and try to beat it on the hardest difficulty.

85657196,english,"This is one of the best games I've played in the last 12 months.
I’m honestly surprised this game hasn’t received more attention, but I suppose an unfortunate release timing just before rival indie rogue-like Hades has hidden this game somewhat – which is a big shame. If you enjoy games like Slay the Spire, Monster Train and Griftlands, you will almost certainly enjoy this game as well.
Star Renegades takes route exploration and permadeath/restart elements from Slay the Spire and mixes them with a more complex version of the turn-based battle style from classic Final Fantasy. On higher difficulties it is highly strategic and you really need to plan your turns out well in order to conserve resources between battles.
Pros:
+ Highly replayable. As you progress through the levels, you build a team of 5 heroes from a possible 14 classes in the game (at time of review).   On top of this, there are dozens of different types of gear you can kit your team out with to further customise and optimise your builds each run.
+ There are several difficulty levels so there’s definitely a challenge level for everyone.
+ (Slightly spoilery) Once you win a run, one of the 14 classes will become unavailable to use in your next attempt. I’ve found this has been a great way of forcing you to mix up your team compositions.
+ The path selection on each level is A LOT less linear than games like Monster Train and Slay the Spire. It’s much more similar to map exploration in tabletop games like For The King. 
+ Great graphics and soundtrack.
+YO THAT OPENING CINEMATIC IS FUCKIN SWEET M8

Cons:

- As I’ve played this game more, I have started to encounter more and more bugs (such as health packs not healing my party, certain items on the map being unclickable). Whilst everything I’ve experienced so far can be easily reset with a quick restart, it is getting slightly annoying. In the short time I’ve had the game though I’ve already seen 2 patches aimed solely at fixing bugs so it looks as though the developers are very active at least.
- The UI gets extremely clustered in some battles when there are multiple participants on both sides. It gets quite hard to see all enemy intents with details and correctly target all of your moves in some cases. The game already has alternative methods to achieve both of these but they are unintuitive at first and I only discovered them by accident.


With a bit more polishing, I honestly believe this game really would be fighting for a place at the top of many peoples favourite game lists.",1612050012,1612050938,True,5,0,0.54020458459854126,0,False,False,False,76561198046252746,79,7,3206,0,2551,1613166544,,

85600536,koreana,"굉장히 잘만든 턴제 로그라이크 게임. 전투 시스템을 오밀조밀하게

잘 짜놨는데, 기획자의 노고가 플레이하는 나까지 느껴진다.

개인적으로 ""압도적으로 긍정적""줘도 아깝지 않다 생각함.

-----------------장점들---------------------------------------

1. 영혼을 갈아넣은 도트 그래픽

- 필자는 사실 도트 그래픽을 그닥 좋아하지 않는데, 그럼에도

   이 게임의 도트 그래픽은 감탄이 나온다. 심지어 불꽃에 반사광

   까지 구현을 해놓았고 전투시 뒷배경 잘 보면 약간 3D로 보이게끔

   도트 그래픽 구현을 해놓았다. 도트 그래픽의 만들어지는 과정이

   얼마나 힘든지 아는 분이라면 더 경이로운 수준이다.

2. 치밀하고 심도 깊은 전투 시스템

- 다른 게임의 치명타는 그냥 일희일비 하는 운빨ㅈ망으로

  구현 되는데, 이 게임은 아주 심플하고 확실하게

  ""먼저 행동하면 치명타""로 정리해놓아 아주 좋았다. 이외에도

   능력과 아이템에 붙어있는 다양한 부가효과를 잘 활용해야

   보스전을 헤쳐나갈 수 있다.

3. 한글화

- 한글 번역의 수준이 아쉽긴 하지만, 그래도 해준게 어디인가. 찬양하라.

4. 신나는 BGM

- 사이버틱하고 신나는 BGM들이 턴제 전투의 루즈함을 줄여준다.

5. 한바퀴 도는 동안 모은 재화로 업그레이드

- 로그라이크로 매우 유명한 하데스에서의 유사한 그 방식. 다양한 아이템, 동료, 기능을

   해금하여 다음 회차때 더 강해져서 시작할 수 있다.

------------단점들--------------------------

1. 게임의 기본적인 난이도가 높다

- 원래 로그라이크가 어려운 장르인건 맞지만, 로그라이크가 대중화 되면서

  게임들의 평균적인 난이도도 떨어지는 추세다(대신 1회차 이후 다양한

  핸디캡 옵션을 키고 끌 수 있게하며 하드코어 게이머도 고려해주는 추세)

  그렇지만, 이 게임은 보통 난이도도 상당히 어려운 축에 속한다.

   필자는 운이 좋았던건지 내가 잘한건지 1회차 첫플레이에 바로 엔딩을 봤는데

   전멸 위기가 여럿차례 있었지만 아슬하게 넘겼고, 수많은 고 난이도 단계가

   있음에도 고작 ""보통""이 이렇게 어렵다는게 조금 놀랐다. 필자도 쓸데없이

    매우 어려운 게임은 혐오하는데, 몇몇 분들에게 있어 이 게임의 보통 난이도 조차

    쓸데없이 너무 어렵지 않을까? 라는 우려는 있다. 만약에 턴제 로그라이크에 대한

    이해도가 적은 분이면 쉬움 난이도 조차 매우 어렵게 다가올 수준이다.

2. 행성(필드)의 다양성 부족

- 동료나 아이템의 다양성은 좋다. 하지만 도는 행성이 매번 계속 똑같고 몹의

   구성도 같기 때문에 빨리 질린다. 만약에 사후 지원 계속 하실 생각이 있으면

   행성의 가짓수를 더 늘려주면 좋지 않을까 싶음

3. 피로도가 꽤 높다

- 몹의 개체수가 많아질 수록 한턴 한턴 고민할 여지가 많아지며 

   한번의 Run 동안 사용하는 시간도 꽤 길기 때문에 가볍게 즐기고 싶은

   게이머분들에게 피곤하다고 느껴질 여지가 있다. 거기에 더해

   이 게임의 전투를 하는데 있어서 핵심적인 정보량이 매우 많다.

   예를 들어 공격의 방식도 약공격/일반공격/강공격/범위공격/연타공격

    반격/반사 등등 다양하게 있고 알아야 하는 각종 키워드나

    디버프 종류도 매우 많다.  적어도 공격 분류를 굳이 왜 했나 싶기도 하다.

      다양한 디버프야 어쩔 수 없다  치고 굳이 공격의 종류를 이렇게

     세분화 했어야 하나라는 의문이 든다.

4. BGM 부족

- 기존에 있는 BGM자체가 신나고 퀄리티 높은 음악인데, 행성도 매번 똑같고

   거기서 나오는 BGM도 매번 똑같다 보니 역시 듣다보면 질리고, 결국에는

   BGM은 끄고 따로 음악틀고 효과음만 듣는 자신을 보게 될 수 있다.

5. 한글화 번역의 아쉬움

- 아무래도 대형 게임사가 아니다보니 한글화 번역해준건 절을 올릴정도로

   감사하지만, 번역의 수준은 아쉬운 수준이다. 특히 로그라이크 게임에서는

   어떤 키워드나 디버프 효과에 대한 정확한 파악이 필수적인데 몇몇 설명이

   오역으로 내가 이해한 효과와 전혀 다르게 나타날 때가 왕왕 있다.

    그리고 보통 이런 상황은 로그라이크 게임에 있어서 치명적이다.

    어떤 키워드나 디버프 설명이 애매하거나 이상하다면 영어가

     가능하신분은 차라리 영어로 하시는게 속편할 듯.

75675676,japanese,"タイムライン式の戦闘がウリです。
グランディアとか好きだった人には合うと思います。
システムが最初わかりにくいですが、理解できるとかなり戦略的になって面白いです。

戦闘の1ターンは60s(second)で表されます。
敵味方ともに各スキルには発動にかかる時間が設定されており、
全員の選択が終わるとターンの処理が始まります。

タイムラインが進むにつれ順次スキルが発動していきます。
スキルには、
・ダメージ
・発動時間
・クリティカル効果（追加ダメージ・アーマー破壊値・よろめき値）
があります。

戦闘で重要なのがクリティカルです。
クリティカルは、そのターンにて攻撃対象より早く行動し攻撃をあてることで発動します。
クリティカルすると、スキルのクリティカル効果が発動します。
アーマー破壊については省略しますが、
よろめき値が戦闘をコントロールする最も重要な要素になります。

基本的に、各ターンすべてのキャラクターが動きますが、
よろめき値をスタックさせることでそのキャラの行動をまるまる数ターン飛ばさせることも可能です。
例として、
40sの発動スキルを構えた敵キャラに対して、
よろめき値 30s x 3 の攻撃を当てると 40 + 90 = 130s　となります。
1ターンは60sなのでこの場合、そのキャラが行動するのは2ターン後の10sになります。
次のターン、そのキャラは行動不能なので発動時間の長いスキルでもクリティカルが発動するのでここで畳みかける、といった動きもできます。

人によってはこの説明だけで面白そうと思うかもですね。自分がそうです。
よろめき値に倍率をかけるデバフもあるのでうまくやると3ターンとか飛ばせます。

各ステージのボスはかなり強く、ぎりぎりの戦いになります。
ボス戦は全滅しない限り、死んでもデメリットはないので、
メンバーの犠牲を前提に戦うとよいです。
苛烈な攻撃をしのいで倒せた時の気持ちよさは随一ですね。

余談ですが、後で入手できるイージスというキャラは、
全体防御スキルで強力な全体攻撃を防いでくれたりします。
その代わりに他のキャラは攻撃に集中できるので、
ここでイージスを犠牲にして倒しきれるか・・・？、みたいに考えながらプレイをしてるとストラテジーしてる感があってすごい面白いです。",1599614539,1611719523,True,72,5,0.879022061824798584,0,True,False,False,76561198054205426,249,2,952,0,952,1599833128,,

If you don't have the Aegis Class in your team it is almost impossible to defend the bomb against attacks. And even with the ageis its really hard because constantly having to block aoes kills her really quick. The final boss has an attack that pireces shields and thus all shield block abilities in the game become useless. 

The bomb is even more useless since its max level is 1, so even though it can be equipt with armor it has to be level 1 armor which basically does nothing. 

The Runs in this game take about 6-7hours and it is really f*** annoying to constantly die on the last bit of hp of the boss just because he does his shield piercing abillity again which there is literally no counter against, since you can't heal hp in fights.

TLDR: It's not bad, but not really worth the price-point and doesn't live up to the advertising that's posted. It's a fun little indie RPG in the turn-based format. 

Characters are lightly written with attempts at humor that ... well often falls flat. It keeps it light-hearted, though, which is nice. There's a lot of strong opinion laced into the narrative and characters that might or might not match your own political pursuasion, and as such you will either love or hate it. 

Characters can also create progeny which unlock characters, but for the most part these are carbon copies of their makers. I say makers because I had a woman and robot make another robot and the children appear to be as old as their parents for reasons I don't understand or care to question too deeply. The new and different characters is a pretty cool easter-egg for unlocking new characters whereas the carbon-copy ones feel a little like false content.

The place where this game really shines is the difficulty and balancing. They nailed making the game a very fun difficulty - for me anyway.  It's an often overlooked feature that developers get wrong and it is this game's best feature. I've had most of my battles against the beheamoths of a planet go right down to the wire.  My team is typically almost dead at the end of these rounds - well, when we win.

I didn't play all the content of the game because it started getting repetitive for me after unlocking the last planet.  Like really, really repetitive. The story is pretty standard RPG fare with less written about it, and thank God, because it wasn't worth the extra time or effort. It wasn't really bad, either, but I'm just saying that you won't play this for the story.

They advertise sub-boss enemies with unique personalities and individual strengths and weaknesses but really that means randomized weaknesses and strengths and one of six or so dialogue varieties. None of them are very interesting and the special screen where you can track them simply adds more time-suck than anything else. I personally groaned whenever they showed dialogue from the sub-bosses or the mothership screens showing which ones are left alive or dead.

Finally, it's a mixed bag of a game that left me on the fence for whether to recommend this game . I got about 20 hours of play out of it and that's the reason I'm not recommending this at the price point I paid. Maybe if it goes on sale then snatch it up. The balancing is well-done, and the graphics and some of the mechanics are fun. The pacing, story, characters, randomized sub-bosses and repetitiveness are not so much.",1611421567,1611421567,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198223850924,82,52,1229,0,1229,1611361572,1613252745.0,"So sorry you found that run-to-run the game was too similar.

The 'timeline' based game-play where you are able to delay enemies' turns and manipulate the battle makes for very satisfying strategic gameplay! 

Pros:
+ Absolutely beautiful pixel art! This is what drew me in!
+ Excellent JRPG style turn-based combat, the best I have ever played
+ Lots of character and item options for build variety
+ Decent storyline, especially for a roguelite!

Cons
+ Runs are on the long side (6+ hours of play time per completed run)
+ For roguelite/like veterans, this game is on the easy side
+ Because of how long the runs are, they can feel very samey
+ Lacks that 'one more run' feel of typical roguelites (mostly due to the run length)
+ Confusing, cluttered UI takes a while to get used to
+ Poor overworld design

Despite the longer list of Cons than pros, this game is absolutely worth the purchase, especially if you enjoy turn based JRPG combat!

다만, 준수한 퀄리티로 한글화는 되었지만, 중간중간 번역을 빼먹은 부분이 있습니다. 게임에 지장을 줄 정도는 아니지만, 게임을 어느정도 진행된 후에 개방되는 훈련소의  내용이 번역되어 있지 않네요.

-------------------------
이 아래는 방구석 게이머의 TMI와 Star Renegades의 스포가 포함되어 있습니다. 시간이 넘치는 분들 한해서 심심풀이로  보세요.

먼저 이 게임의 난이도에 대한 이야기를 먼저 하고 싶네요. 보통은 로그라이크 = 어려운 난이도라는 인식과 별개로  Star Renegades는 꽤나 난이도가 준수한 편에 속합니다. 게임 시스템을 빨리 파악하고,  잘 이용하면 1회차에 클리어도 가능할 듯 싶고, 필자도 2회차만에 게임을 클리어했습니다. 
이는 바인딩 오브 아이작이나 위자드 오브 레전드,Slay the Spire와 달리 Star Renegades는 로그라이크 특유의 운빨 X망겜 요소를 거의 잘라냈기 때문인데, 랜덤하게 나오는 장비, 액세사리는 주는데로 받아먹어도 문제없고, 기술을 랜덤하게 얻는 것도 아니며 그나마 랜덤이 있는 매 행성 마지막에 영입하는 이탈자도 게임 자체가 특정 영웅의 조합보다는 게임 시스템을 잘 이용하는 것이 관건이라 그리 크지 않았다고 생각합니다. 물론 조합을 작정하고 무시하는 것만 아니라면요.
개인적으로는 이것이 좋았고 게임 시스템을 잘 이용하게 만들었다고 생각하지만, 덕분에 게임의 요소, 예를 들어 거점의 훈련소나 이탈자 해금, 무기 해금을 층분히 하지 않았는데 게임을 클리어하여 아쉬웠습니다. 또한, 이 랜덤성의 거세는 좀 과하게 적용되었다고 생각합니다. 

일단 난이도에 대한 것은 이정도고 게임의 장점에 대해 이야기하면 크게 세계관, 그래픽 등이 있습니다.
먼저 세계관, 보통의 로그라이크는 죽으면 모든 것을 잃고 처음부터 시작하는 것이 게임의 시스템인데 이걸 게임 세계관으로 직관적으로 잘 설명했습니다. 차원을 침략하는 세력이 있고, 만약 이번 차원에서 막는데 실패하면 다른 차원으로 이동해 그곳에 있는 캐릭터로 다시 침략에 대비한다. 여기에 추가로 저번 차원에서 얻은 정보와 기술로 이번 차원에서 더욱 대비된 상태로 맞선다. 직관적이고, 납득이 잘되는 세계관이었습니다. 이외에 기타 세부 설정, 타이탄이니 차원이니, 제국이니 같은 자잘한 내용이 흥미로웠습니다. 설명이 부족해서 파도 나오는게 적었지만;;; 비중도 그리 크지는 않은 것이 아쉽웠습니다. 다만 세계관과 스토리는 별개입니다. 이는 단점에서...

그 다음에 그래픽, 이 게임 그래픽은 매우~ 좋았습니다. 픽셀 분위기에 화려한 애니메이션, 매려적인 디자인과 합쳐져 기술을 쓸 때마다 감탄했습니다. 애니메이션을 돌려쓴 부분이 없지않아 있지만, 이 정도면 준수했고, 개인적으로 필자는 그래픽을 보고 게임을 구입했고, 매우 만족스러웠습니다. 

이외에도 겹치지 않는 특징이 캐릭터들, 적의 행동을 봉쇠하는 것이 중점인 독특한 게임 시스템, 캐릭터 간의 상호작용 등 여러 장점이 있었습니다.

물론 단점도 있죠. 사실 단점보다는 아쉬운 점에 가깝습니다. 어디까지나 '개인적으로' 아쉬운 내용들이죠. 크게 스토리,  아쉬운 적의 특징이 있었습니다. 

스토리, 아까 세계관과 스토리는 별개라고 했는데 이 게임은 총 4개의 스테이지로 이루어져 있습니다. 문제는 이 중 3개의 스테이지가 행성에 파묻혀있는 핵의 사수라는 이야기를 반복한다는 점입니다. 무슨 핵을 이용하면 차원을 여는 포탈이 커져 더 많은 대군이 몰려와 막지 못한다. 해서 한 행성에 핵을 지키면 저쪽 핵이 위험하다고 그쪽으로 가는 것을 반복하니 좀 아쉬웠습니다. 에피소드를 좀 더 살려 세계관을 좀 더 묘사했다면 좋았을 것이라 생각이 들었습니다. 

-엔딩 스포 항목은 삭제되었습니다.-

그리고 적의 특징, 적에게는 여러 특징이 있습니다. 약공격에 저항, 강공격에 취약, 특정 공격에 격노 등, 여러 특징이 있는데 이걸 공략하는 재미나 비중이 그리 크지가 많았습니다. 파동 공격에 취약인데 우리 쪽에는 파동 공격이 없습니다. 그런 캐릭터가 파티에 없기보다는 그런 캐릭터가 그 시기에는 존재하지 않아요! 생명력의 재생이 빠르데요, 그럼 회복하는 것보다 빨리 패는 느낌이 있어야하는데 채감이 안될 정도로 미미합니다. 이게 특징이 랜덤이거나 보스(스테이지 마지막)가 랜덤이면 그러러니 하는데, 이게 또 고정이다 보니 싸운 적과 싸우고, 특징은 똑같고, 특징은 채감이 안되어 아쉬웠습니다. 위에서 랜덤성의 절개가 과하게 적용되었다는 점이 이 부분입니다. 보스 특징이 뚜렸하지만, 그게 반복되고, 이게 보스에 맞추는 조합의 필요성이 큰 것도 아니니, 스탯 조정은 필요하겠지만 랜덤으로만 했어도 나았을 것 같았습니다.

물론, 이 게임은 단점보다 장점이 눈에 띄고 그 단점도 개인적인 아쉬움에 가까워 추천할 만한 게임이라고 생각합니다. 오랜만에 만족스럽게 플레이했고 리뷰를 쓴 이후 다시 게임을 플레이하러 갈 생각입니다.",1608975795,1610757406,True,6,0,0.617486357688903809,0,True,False,False,76561198215345577,154,50,1961,0,1559,1610875688,,

Очень интересная система боя с временной шкалой, когда каждое действие занимает определенное количество времени, так сказать, на подготовку. А ты своими воинами можешь смещать противника по этой шкале или вовсе перекидывать в следующий раунд. При этом количество данных сдвигов у противника ограничено, что вполне объяснимо.

Вообще я не любитель рогаликов, когда суть геймплейя умирать и заново проходить. Лучше сложно, медленно, но верно проходить, изучать и побеждать. Но тут ничего не поделаешь.
Графика здесь на любителя. Не фанатею от пикселей в современных играх. Есть игры, в которых это более уместно. В данном случае я бы больше предпочел более детальную картинку. Но такой стиль, тут тоже ничего не поделаешь.
Музыка в игре просто никакая. Не понимаю, почему про нее пишут положительные отзывы. Сам стиль озвучки и музыки мне очень нравится, однако на глобальной карте мелодия, такое ощущение, повторяется каждые 10 секунд. За 5 часов игры очень надоела. Выкрутил громкость музыки на минимум.

전투는 처음에는 복잡한것처럼 느껴지지만, 결국은 선빵을 어떻게 칠것인가 싸움입니다. 

선빵을 친다면 치명타가 100% 들어가게되고, 치명타가 들어갈때만 스킬의 보너스 효과가 적용되므로 이 게임에서 치명타와 평타의 차이나 엄청 납니다. 

치명타를 때릴수 없다면, 그냥 회복하거나 방어를 취해 피해를 최소화시켜서, 다음 턴에서 치명타 권한을 얻는게 기본 택틱입니다.

To all of you guyes who complain that this game is too hard, it's NOT. it's exeptionally fair, since there is minimal random influence on each run compared to most rogue lite games. 
I've now beaten the game 3 times, and NOT lost ONCE . 1 on Normal, 1 on Hard and 1 on Extreme. 
You just have to understand how to exploit the staggering mecanics correctly and have a good balanced team. 

Pros: 
-Excellent combat that is very deterministic and tactical. If you play smart you will win on the first game you play (I did)
- minimal random chance that can ruin a run. The combat in this game are all displayed in front of you and it's up to you to learn the system and take advantage of it to win. 
- The game has a excellent tutorial and you can win on your first try with the starting heros. 
- Amazing pixel graphics

Cons. 
- Each run took me 7 hours and that is a really long time for these kinds of games. It would be really frustrating to lose near the end.
- the interactions between the characters is abit weak, and the random recycled dialog underminds the good parts.
- the start of each run is abit slow and dull as you have few abilities but it picks up quickly

overall I highly reccomend this game if you are the patient sort who likes good strategy sicne the game takes a while

처음하시는 분들과 1회차 클리어를 하지 못하신 분들을 위해 팁을 좀 적어두겠습니다.

1. 캐릭터(이탈자)
개인적으로는 처음 주어지는 조합인 발키리(윈 사이펙스), 집정관(넉스 적자), 공작원(노도 칼토리스)조합을 추천합니다. 
방어자 보다는 발키리로 초반의 부족한 딜을 보탬해줄 수 있으며, 공작원의 공세를 이용해 적을 쉽게 동요시켜 피해를 막고, 집정관의 보호막 충전으로 긴 전투에 큰 도움을 줄 수 있습니다.
각 캐릭터가 배울 수 있는 기술과 야영 카드는 [분대]를 클릭해 각 캐릭터 이름 오른쪽 옆에 사각형 6개가 2*3으로 배치된 걸 클릭해 확인할 수 있습니다.
 
2. 동선
이 게임은 여러분이 얼마나 캐릭터들의 장갑과 생명력을 유지하느냐에 따라서 난이도가 크게 달라집니다.
그렇기에 여러분들의 동선 진행 방향에 따라서 난이도 체감이 달라질 것입니다. 
첫 번째 행성에서 화염방사병과의 전투는 피하시는 것을 추천 드리며 장비보다는 DNA위주로 수급하는것을 추천합니다.
이후 2 번째 행성부터는 장비수급과 밤에 들어갈 수 있는 추가 전투맵을 최대한 활용해 많은 DNA를 수급하는 것을 추천합니다. 

3. 전투
처음하시면 전투 방식이 어렵다고 생각하실 수 있으시겠지만 생각보다 간단한 구성입니다.
-1. 전투에서 중요한 것은 상대의 광역공격과 장갑파괴가 큰 공격을 동요 또는 기절로 막는 것
-2. 후방적을 공격하기 위한 전방 적 섬멸
-3. 아군의 공격을 최대한 선 공격으로 실행해 적에게 치명타 공격을 내주지 않기
로 나눌 수 있습니다.
대부분 크고 단단하게 생긴 적(화염방사병과 같은) 적들은 광역 공격을 가지고 있습니다. 그렇기에 이런 적들을 상대할 때에는 동요와 기절을 이용해하거나 방어를 이용해 집정관이 보호막 충전으로만 턴을 허비하지 않도록 합시다.
더구나 동요와 기절을 이용해 딜 타이밍을 얻어낼 수 있으므로 최대한 이를 활용할 수 있도록 합시다.
 
4. 야영
야영 카드는 3가지로 나눌 수 있습니다.
-1. 사용해도 소모되지 않는 카드(캐릭터 카드)
-2. 사용시 소모되는 카드(식량 지급기로 받는 카드)
-3. 우정카드
발키리(윈 사이펙스)의 카드는 아군의 생명력을 50%를 1자원만으로 회복할 수 있어 초반에 생명력이 부족하더라도 이를 해결 할 수 있습니다. 개인적으로 식량 지급기 보다는 장비와 DNA위주의 파밍이 더 효율적이라고 생각합니다. 캐릭터 레벨업시 새로 생기는 카드들의 능력도 보조하기에는 휼륭하기 때문입니다. 

5. 관계도
더불어 카드를 주고 받으며 생기는 관계도 역시 중요한 요소 중 하나 입니다. 각 하트마다 [친구], [동료], [동반자]를 뜻 합니다.
[친구] 관계가 되면 캐릭터에게 특성이 생기고, [동료]가 되면 합체기술, [동반자]가되면 다음 회차시 사용할 수 있는 후손을 가질 수 있습니다.
제가 플레이 하며 알아낸 것 중 몇개를 적어두면,
[친구] 
집정관(적스 넉자)과 친구가 되면 보호막증가와 매 라운드 보호막 재생 
방어자(마리야디 펜레이브)와 친구가 되면 생명력 증가와 보호막 증가 
[동료]
발키리(윈 사이펙스)와 집정관(적스 넉자)의 관계도를 동료로 만들면 휼륭한 광역 합체 기술
발키리(윈 사이펙스)와 공작원(노도 칼토리스)의 관계도를 동료로 만들면 어느 위치의 적이든 기절 시킬 수 있는 합체 기술
을 얻을 수 있습니다.
각 캐릭터 마다 적어도 친구 관계는 만들어 특성을 획득하게 한다면 게임이 한 층 수월해질 겁니다.

84191084,english,"I have over 200 hours on the game as of posting this, mostly played on switch.
(I got this game for free on steam but bought on switch)
This is an excellent game, undoubtedly one of the best that I've ever played. It has an amazing visual style, far beyond many and perhaps every popular game. True, it is 2D, but the amount of detail dedicated to every single frame is astounding, no wonder it is hard to run on switch.

Truly, problems do exist, many bugs, none of them make the game unplayable on steam, but they do interfere somewhat with gameplay. They are nothing to worry about, really.

Some lunatic a while ago posted a review that I considered utterly unacceptable and biased. This game is a rouguelite, which implies that you will repeat the problem in a slightly different but always challenging way. Saying that the game is redundant or repetitive is attacking the whole point of the game and genre of 'rogues'. There is no completion, the fight always continues. The point is to play the process, the construction and development. 

This game tests your skills in several ways, as difficulty increases, it is necessary to know more of it. Some dude complained about 'difficulty spikes' on bosses. It is true, you have time to prepare and generate a COMPETENT strategy. After some playthroughs, you will know exactly who you will fight where, sometimes you can even determine how and when, since you can adjust your strategies in several ways: The pick-a-path fixes the pain of linearity of Slay the Spire and improves on the map selection/reward acquisition of Into the Breach and the burden of sacrificing rewards and tough fights that Hades introduces.

This game is about knowledge, uncertainty management, and complex team building. It is quite intellectually demanding on higher difficulties, one must prepare carefully for the challenges presented, enemies have Strengths, abilities, immunities and weaknesses. An adaptation process is important every step of the way.  

I would say the main weakness of the game is its LONG campaign, commonly rouguelikes and roguelites distinguish themselves by lasting about an hour, one and a half hours if you really decided to think through and also take the long way. This game needs 4 hours per campaign, which is titanic compared to the average of the genre. For a gamer like me, who likes to finish what he starts ASAP, means that whenever I play I require the full 4 hours on it. It is a really enjoyable time I must say, but the time consumption is a weakness that cannot be emphasized enough.  This is* considering fast animations during fights on my average gameplay, so its hard to summon that kind of space in anyone's life. 

Should you buy it?
if you like to think and truly conquer foes (not taking damage is not a measurement of an easy game, it is a measurement of a challenge conquered).
if you like to plan and create harmonic teams
if you like visuals, audio, and constant high quality updates

Then this game is for you.

融合了很多游戏元素：
1.首先这是一个roguelike游戏，不过就是一轮战斗的时间很长，如果你处在探索阶段，每一场战斗都深思熟虑，可能一轮要就几个小时
2.这游戏借鉴了暗黑地牢的扎营系统，在任务中可以扎营休息，每次扎营都可以使用各个角色的扎营技能，提升属性或回复生命。同时为其他单位加buff还会增加单位之间的好感度
3.好感度提升到一个阶段会触发对话，增加这两个单位之间的特殊增益。我第一感觉像火焰之纹章的好感系统，不过要简化很多，没有角色相性要求，没有站位要求。不知道好感度会不会影响后续剧情发展或结局。
4.战斗中，敌人会明确告知下一轮的行动，明确会造成的伤害，这点比较像杀戮尖塔
5.最没想到的是它竟然还融合了一个中土世界（兽人经理）的元素。每个星球会有几个指挥官，可以在“帝国”界面看到指挥官的属性技能。如果被敌人打败，这个敌人就会得到晋升成为精英单位。

战斗系统也有自己的特色：
1.攻击能延迟敌人的行动，造成敌人一回合轮空
2.暴击系统不再是运气，而是攻击 有攻击意图的单位一定会造成暴击效果，且暴击效果不止是简单的增加伤害，还有各式各样的取决于技能效果的列如破甲、延迟的效果。

评价：
1. 战斗的特效真是我见过像素风回合制里最流畅的了

2. 游戏有不少角色可以使用，但角色的rpg养成要素并没什么自由，不能选择技能，也不能选择天赋分支。一切都是由升级直接解锁人物新能力。唯一可以选择的只是给角色穿什么装备，而装备系统更接近roguelike是随机获取或者用有限的金钱在商店里购买。
缺乏人物养成是我觉得比较可惜地方

3. 战斗节奏比较慢，战斗的次数感觉并不算特别多，但是我自己体验下来战斗却要用很长时间。
我个人理解的原因，抛开一部分是我还没熟悉系统处在开荒阶段
战损惩罚很重，因为没有太多机会给你回复血量和护甲，而每轮战斗又很长。所以每次战斗必须倾向于无伤。
所谓的无伤不是完全不被打中，而是不损失血量护甲。护盾在战斗结束自动回复，可以算是“无伤”的容错。
敌人的伤害很高，对己方非坦克单位是致命的，敌人还会使用全方位aoe，让你不得不考虑取舍
在跟精英单位的战斗中，你需要收集的信息很多，这就导致战斗实际花费的时间很长。

[b]PROS[/b]
Really fun game with gorgeous graphics and engaging combat. I would have never thought a turn-based JRPG-style game could be so tactical until playing this game, and I played a lot of them growing up. There are a lot of ways to optimize your turns through careful planning of attacks and staggers. As you move through the difficulty levels these decisions go from simply being ideal to being absolutely necessary to survive.

Outside of combat, there are some very interesting design choices made with this game. Your party members can form relationships which give certain bonuses as well as unlocking new characters, there are branching paths which require some careful planning to optimize your run (think FTL mixed with a board game and a JRPG overworld), shops / recruitment between planets, and leveling is based on a shared resource rather than individual experience points (you can dump everything into a couple characters, distribute them among everyone, etc.).

[b]CONS[/b]
[i]Frustrating UI/UX[/i] - For a turn-based JRPG-like, you will pretty much live inside of menus. Some UI/UX issues that I might let slide in another genre just becomes frustrating after a few hours of playing. Picking targets can feel clunky at times, getting information about who is being attacked from whom can become nearly impossible when there are a lot of AOE attacks going on, not enough attention is given to status effects (and it's just as clunky finding out what is going on), and damage calculations can be hard to read (I sometimes have a hard time knowing how much damage my selected character is actually going to be doing as opposed to how much everyone else is doing)

[i]Unintended Double Button Presses[/i] - Sometimes a single button press on the controller will be read as multiple, which can mean the difference between winning and losing a fight (imagine targeting an enemy with a strong counter attack and full health instead of the other enemy with 1 HP because the game read an input twice instead of once). Fortunately, you are allowed a single redo of a turn per run, but you might not get a chance to use it if the mistake is too catastrophic.

[i]Repetitive Runs[/i] - There isn't much variety from one run to the next. The combat and party compositions are fun enough to play through the game multiple times, but I don't see myself playing this too much longer. That being said, I've already gotten more out of my purchase than a lot of the AAA games that are out there. I'd say this is more of a matter of being spoiled by the replayability of some of the absolute roguelite gems that have come out over the years. I wouldn't let this dissuade you from purchasing the game, just set your expectations accordingly.",1609919387,1609919387,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197992585961,157,18,3165,0,2073,1612409058,,

The combat is very satisfying and whenever i die i never feel cheated out of a win, i always feel that there is something i could have done better. The match make minigame at campsites is incredibly simple but incredibly well done. 
My only complaints would be little things like ""i want more prodigy heroes"" or ""the combat froze for like 5 milliseconds"" which is all stuff that will become better as the game continues to be developed and improved.
Bottom line, this game is incredible maybe you wont sit down for 5 hours doing runs, maybe you wont but you will enjoy this game if you like rougelit and/or JRPG games.

combat keeps you mildly involved. whether to boost a teammates shields, disrupt an enemys attack, strike the final blow or just watch everyone burn to death, decisions matter and go beyond throwing your heaviest whatever at it. theres shields and armor and health and stagger limits and initiative and it all does make sense. eventually

the randomness is as game altering as weapon pods in contra or items in mario kart. a lot of gear and upgrades will do the job but of course youre always going to want the spread gun or the blue shell. every run (which is cleverly implemented into the narrative) will be slightly different than the last with enough variety to not get boring and enough consistency to make progress worthwhile

Spoilers for the initial ending and one last gripe I have with this game below.
[spoiler]There's a system in this game that when you win a run, the current leader of the bad guys is replaced with a different playable character and makes that character unusable, which is good! It makes planning runs more interesting. This is fine on its own, but it also disallows you from using any progeny heroes related to that character... which wouldn't be a problem if that system worked as intended, but it actually makes any progeny heroes that can POSSIBLY be related to that hero unusable, not just the ones that actually are. (Some progeny heroes will appear as offspring of a certain selection of characters with the main parent, of which the new villain leader may not actually be one.) This ultimately just locks off 50% of the progeny heroes at complete random, which is just kind of annoying.

80697398,english,"I originally left a positive review that you can find below, but the cons outweigh the pros after a few runs.
It's far too hard to tell what are enemies' strong and weak points, especially bosses.

The game sets itself in monotony after a few runs and relies way too much on you having to know by heart the strategy to use against each boss, making it no more than a rock - paper - scissors gameplay.

Some bosses you have zero chances at winning against because they either use complex patterns you cannot counter without knowing beforehand, or have way too many stats to be able to beat.
Encountering flat run enders because you didn't prepare to beat that one boss a certain way from the beginning of the run is really frustrating.

Past the first run, you get the feeling no progress is being made, either. You can only unlock new weapons and try new strategies but that's it.
------
What if the Phantasy Star series were a roguelite?
This game answers it, and delivers a really satisfying experience mixing turn by turn strategy rpg, retro music, and sci-fi aesthetics.
It's a roguelike jrpg, but unlike roguelikes, it doesn't make you feel bad for your inevitable defeat.
Losing is explained in the story by the fact you go back in time before dying, and all you collected during your run allows you to unlock stuff you unlocked during your last run earlier.
The enemy which defeated you gets a cutscene of it being promoted for killing you by the bad guy (you probably get an added bonus for killing it in the next run) and you get reset to the start so you can collect your rewards.

The characters you recruit are presented as fully fledged characters, too. You can gain events and combo attacks by raising their affection levels towards one another.
It's reset upon losing your run, however.

There are way more characters than your team can hold, so it'll take some time before you get bored of it.
It really reminds me of Chrono Trigger in some way, except it's a roguelike.

The battle system is pretty great, too. Not sure where they took their inspiration from, but every attack has a delay, and if you attack first your attack gets added benefits like more damage or delaying the enemy, allowing for delay chains.
Maybe Grandia was the inspiration?

Honestly, I was pretty lukewarm with the character designs, but the characters have been given enough depth to grow attached to them, I did not expect that. I just expected them to be throwaway nameless fodder characters.

Spoiler: Plot twist, the main character you used to reach the ending becomes the end boss in the next run, and you can't use them until you beat them again. It's an endless cycle of beating yourself over and over.

83453225,english,"First of all, most of the negative reviews on steam for this game are just complaints about Roguelite fundamentals (Grindy, unforgiving, feels unfair, requires many hours of knowledge to understand etc etc) So with that out of the way.

This game is fantastic.  Without a doubt one of the best turn based Roguelites on the market now.  The art  and music are AMAZING.  They bring the game to life so much more than you would think. The animations are nice and chunky and powerful feeling and just keep you super hooked. One negative could be the story. If you're in to these game for story, it's not really a focal point. 

The map exportation and randomness on each run is awesome, and in my opinion a step above what we have seen in past games of this genre. I find myself very engaged in the ""in-between battle"" stuff. It has a very cool game play loop and it's very unique.

The battle system itself is fantastic.  Do not be fooled by the small amount of options when you start the game. This is a true Roguelite in that, as you play, you unlock more, and more, and more.. And it just keeps expanding and opening up as you do more runs. There's tons of class combinations, equipment, abilities, unlocks, upgrades, WAY more classes to unlock than the game leads you to believe, and all that good stuff.

So of course the big possible turn off point for many people trying out this genre for the first time is the difficulty (I am basing this off of ""Normal"" difficulty).  Yes it's pretty brutal and unforgiving.  You will feel like it's unbalanced, and you will feel like it's unfair.

75661386,english,"Tries hard to be like ""Into the breach"" without movement and locked-in turn-based combat.

High enemy HP can have resistances that make them virtually unbeatable with early parties, so they just run away, which is the only enemy action so far, that can never be interrupted. If that isn't dumb, I don't know what is.

Items will have status effects, that are anything but self-explanatory, e.g. ""rattled"", but what they exactly do, the game doesn't tell you. Even the self-explanatory ones, like ""Burn"" will NOT tell you any numerics. You have to take the item (choose one out of 3 at item pickup events), equip it, and then hit an enemy in the next fight to see what it actually does.

Sorry, but for a non-EA title, sh*t like this is hilarious. These are horrible oversights for a game that claims anything ""tactical"". Informed decisions require a player to be able to *know* what things do, not give it a try and know the next time.

Really disappointed, gonna see how/what the devs are going to do about this and other issues, but so far, the game seems really rough in some departments, even for the low quality standards of the ""rogue-anything"" genre, as 90% of players will just accept any random BS here.

And ofc, I tried a few things to see if it was me, or a flaw with the game, so I got a bit over my 2hrs, otherwise, I'd refund this on the spot. The game also seems ""clunky"" as in, it will take a lot of time just to manoeuver around and do trivial stuff, which is always annoying. E.g. before you make camp, random stuff will appear on the map which you have to go back and collect. Nothing happened in between, it just got dark. Why can't you give me all this stuff before? Why do you have to make me run around the spots I have just been to collect it?

Same with an enemy running away, if you know you can't kill it, you just can't skip a turn. You gotta assign actions and then wait until combat starts (at least that you can fast forward).

I could go on about a lot of other annoying things, which are either appearing as oversights or just badly explained, rushed things, or just shouldn't be in a game, ever, but you get the drift.

Except for the obvious things, stated above, the game suffers from a ton of annoying details, which are just tedious and together, make a very bad impression. 

Style and soundtrack are the silver lining, but combat is neither special nor outstanding. If you want deterministic done right, play Into the Breach, or Griftlands if you like cardbattlers, or Slay the Spire if you have really missed 3 years or so.


Edit: Played a little more, and apart from collecting r*tarded ""Funny"" votes one gets for rightfully criticising a steaming pile of sh*t like this (fanboys really ARE cancer, who would've thought?), which are hilarious, it gets even worse. As you traverse through the worlds, you collect more mediocre heroes which add a little (often not even that) in terms of mechanics, but overall it stays bland and uninteresting. Being able to blast through 2 planets without so much as a scratch on, it seems completely OK to be f*cked in the first fight or so on the 3rd. Enemies here will have literally uncounterable, unstunnable moves that can instakill anyone they choose to attack while ALSO breaking defense. The game has not even a smidge of actual strategy or tactics in it, the game permanently thinks it's smart or challenging by throwing situations at you where you absolutely need to make informed decisions, while not allowing you to access any information required for it.

Plus, it has the most r*etarded and shoddy fronline/backline mechanic I EVER saw in a game. And I played a few. Half the time it isn't even clear how many enemies are in the frontline as it looks like 3 are standing on the same layer, how could you f*ck up something so basic?

The fact, that the devs claim this game is deterministic (the game literally points out that ""fact"") only shows their grave incompetence in the game design department. A labour of love with sh*tty mechanics doesn't save a bad game. The game is literally not deterministic. It has ONE deterministic element, but as in everything else in this game, it only gives you 50% information. This game is not deterministic, combat is slow and horrible, and every design so far is either just basic, uninspired, meh, or in some cases virtually the worst I have seen in a game of this type. 

Wow. This game is sh*t, really, really sh*t. Get it on sale, or not at all. 


This was the last time I give these sh*tlords of devs a chance. Halcyon 6 was garbage in SOME departments, but they chose to stick with the dumbest decisions from there (which also have rightfully been criticised there) and implemented it here. The game is cancer, but as often in the industry, it only shows, that people will upvote pure sh*t if you pack it neatly, as the art is the only saving grace. 

To all the ""funny"" voters: Every breath I take without your approval raises my self-esteem, keep them coming!

Edit: Ah, yes, more!

Edit: Game still ripe with bugs, months after release. The game is still a sh*tty puzzler, a really, really boring one. And it is by far the slowest self-claimed ""rogue like"" I ever saw. The completely superfluous and cancerous movement on the overland map makes ZERO sense, in fact, why even bother with it? It adds absolutely nothing. Just show me clear outlines and a strategic map, forget all the movement between individual areas just like in ""Into the breach"". 

But hey, at least now, months after release, you can finally view what weapons stats actually do before picking them up...

The devs have dropped every imaginable ball here, the game is just garbage. It is not unplayable or horrible, it just isn't what they claim, nor is it fun. It is arduous, tedious and just boring, with some very shallow ""rogue like"" mechanics slapped on a very lazy turn based that wastes your time. It does not respect the player's time at all. You want everything, literally *everything* this game does, except really well done? Play ""Into the breach"". Easy as that. This game only shows all the flaws that Halcyon6 had, and brings them to the surface.

75829222,english,"EDIT: I'm now 40+ hours in. I would recommend only if you really enjoy these rogue-lite RPG games; it is most similar to Darkest Dungeon, but not as fun.The game length is 6-8 hours so you cant always finish in one sitting- this was my biggest annoyance. too long that you cant keep playing after failed attempt (like an FTL), and is not divided into short missions even if it is long (like a darkest dungeon).
After learning the mechanics, the game is almost boringly easy; have 1 hero that breaks (""stuns"") enemy, 1 hero to tank, 1 hero to deal bonus damage to that stunned enemy. its very basic core mechanic is too optimal and doesn't have much room for other team archetypes to shine based on the bosses you will face (they are always the same bosses).
The developers have been updating this game very regularly post-release, so that is a very good sign. They need to reduce the number of worlds to 3 (shorten the run time), then have the extra worlds rotate randomly each run so you face different bosses/mobs each time, and have the extra random events not as extra maps but as extra fights.

-----

+ POSITIVES
+ a lot of customization. equip different weapons, devices, armor on up to 5 different heroes, and you can level heroes up to level 10, each level unlocking skills or temporary buffs.
+ replayability with different heroes, and if you increase their relationship from previous runs they create progeny heroes
+ cool persistent lives of enemies and heroes. if you die to an enemy unit ending your run, the game promoted the enemy and you meet it next run. I've only beat it once, but cool to unlock heroes and their progeny (lol)
+ tactics matter and you're heavily punished for incorrect plays. deciding order of attacks on timeline, inspecting enemy traits, weaknesses, strengths goes a long way, selecting the correct skills and targetting the correct enemies is important
+ each hero has multiple skills that are useful in different situations. 

- NEGATIVES
-UI is overcrowded. overlapping hero models made it harder to select heros, determine where enemy attacks were targetted, and it got worse later in the game with more heroes on your team and more enemies
- no explanation of any statuses and effects of items, skills, units and what they do. they dont have a complete wiki for the game either 
- item shops could be improved. they give you 3 options. at least one of the items have throwaway stats (e.g. sword that goes on heavy attack hero, buffing light attacks). items are usually higher level than current hero levels, which makes you stockpile DNA (and delay levelling) until you find item chest so you can see the item you want to buy then level that hero. what should be enjoyable is sometimes annoying
- camping system didn't feel fleshed out, camping cards give temporary buffs, but you also want to send cards to and from specific heroes to improve relationships. sometimes i felt just spamming cards to build the relationship instead of caring for which buffs they are; the only cards i really cared about targetting was healing cards
-map movement was clunky, often get stuck on autopathing around map
-30% of game is down time just wasted in night time walking around map to pick up randomly spawned DNA/coins, walking around a new behemoth map that has nothing to explore and just a straight path, navigating UI to check shop and check inventory then re-check shop. there's already camp mode for downtime, the fun dies down a lot between battles.",1599882890,1609163315,True,36,0,0.788642942905426025,0,True,False,False,76561198047526368,80,36,2779,0,2779,1607170554,,

Most importantly, it has that X-Factor a great game has to have - my first run started half an hour before bedtime, and I thought I had only been playing for an hour or two by the time my morning alarm went off.

It's a really interesting spin on the classic JRPG turn based combat, and turns every round into a little tactical puzzle where you need to use each party member's kit to the fullest to dance on the knife's edge - perfectly gaming the risk-to-reward ratio will have you coasting out of battles unscathed, while careless missteps will have you bleeding to death catastrophically like any good roguelike.  

The little details, like the predictive timeline updating turn order as you hover your mouse over your different stuns and slows, take what might be a needlessly overwrought take on the classic formula and present them effortlessly and smoothly.

В целом - обычная jRPG. В нашем распоряжении есть несколько бойцов со своими способностями и артефактами.
Не забывайте, Star Renegades - tactical rogue-lite RPG. Умер? Повтори забег!
Во всей этой ""старой"" jRPG системе боя есть одна очень интересная составляющая - [u]шкала действий (шкала инициативы).[/u]
Суть в том, что каждое действие требует определённого времени на ""подготовку"". 
Т.е. по факту наши бойцы тратят время на удар/выстрел/защиту и т.д.
На основании затраченного на действие времени и происходит расчёт очерёдности ходов.
За очерёдностью ходов приходится следить. В одних ситуациях лучше провести быстрый удар и нанести критический урон (Критический урон наносит тот, кто ходит первым), 
в других - пропустить удар по себе, но добить противника более сильной атакой (на подготовку сильной атаки тратится больше времени).
С этой же особенностью игры связана и вторая интересная механика - [u]ошеломление и прерывание.[/u]
При нанесении критического урона мы откидываем врага по шкале инициативы. 
1. Первым бойцом подготавливаем сильную атаку; 2. Вторым бойцом необходимо ошеломить противника и откинуть его за первого бойца; 3. Проходит сильная критическая атака от нашего первого бойца; 4. Profit. 
Подобными действиями мы можем прервать атаку соперника и выкинуть его со шкалы инициативы на этот раунд. На мой взгляд, это очень полезные способности. Всегда держу с собой одного бойца поддержки с атакой на длительное ошеломление.
У каждого противника есть лимит ошеломлений, постоянно держать в стане не получится.

Между приключениями по карте наши бойцы останавливаются на отдых, разбивают лагерь. 
В лагере герои могут выполнять определённые действия, улучшая друг с другом отношения.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2223363801
У каждого бойца есть карты действия: лечение, восстановить щиты, баф на пробивание брони и т.д.
Так же в лагере можно кого-нибудь заромансить. В Обучении нам торжественно заявили, что по итогам улучшения отношений возможно даже появление ""героев-потомков""!
Проверим. Я уже начал романсить парочку: главная героиня и пиксельный Нейтан Филлион. 

Ещё одно интересное решение - [u]развитие боссов[/u], тут они называются ""супостаты"" и ""исполины"". За уничтожение нашего отряда боссам начисляются различные бонусы.

После каждого поражения нас возвращает на Базу Ренегатов. Мы можем нанять нового бойца, купить оружие (будет случайным образом появляться на карте) и снова отправится в бой.

[i]Какой же здесь классный визуал... Все эти анимированные бэкграунды во время сражений, удары, взрывы![/i]

Музыка понравилась, а вот сюжет совсем не интригует, диалоги тоже только для галочки. Нейтан пытается шутить, но у него это плохо получается.
Кстати, меня очень удивила возможность выхода из игры во время боя! Всё сохраняется, переигрывать не нужно.

Некоторые игроки жалуются на плохую оптимизацию игры - лагает и ест много ресурсов. У меня подобных проблем не возникает.

Честно говоря, я не на 100% уверен в высокой реиграбельности. Слабовата игра как rogue-lite, по крайней мере, на данном этапе.
К сожалению, мне бы хотелось видеть Star Renegades только как tactical RPG, без rogue-lite составляющей.

UPD: 
Разработчики выпустили патч и опубликовали роадмап на будущее. Они не собираются забрасывать проект и будут добавлять контент!
Из плохого:
Обнулили мой последний забег, оставалось 2 битвы. Вход в игру после патча - поражение, пришлось начинать новый забег.
Появились фиолетовые квадраты вместо эффектов взрыва.
С очередным обновлением проблема пропала. Над игрой постоянно работают, добавляют новых персонажей и оружени.

80738261,english,"I want to love this game but it needs a lot of work still. I bought the game on release, and from the moment you enter the game you can tell it's just not finished yet. While the devs have incorporated their updates for the game within itself [your home base has/d unfinished buildings that have now been turned into something, or seeing which enemies you are up against in the ""Imperium"" you can see several empty spots where they are obviously going to add onto the game] and with the newest update adding another planet, enemies, and abilities you can see which spot it claimed.

The devs have done a good job adding stuff to their game and updating since release to improve things about the UI or clarity in combat mechanics, and while this is all very much appreciated, it just goes to show that the game is indeed not finished. 

You are supposed to be able to plan your combat actions out based on what the enemies are doing, you can see their intentions and you plan accordingly. However, there are many times where the combat result shows one of your characters will survive, but then after the actions play out they do not make it. At any difficulty this is frustrating, but in the harder difficulties, you cannot afford these mistakes and it almost makes the game unplayable at times. There are also situations where I know I will kill an enemy but the game will not show that with the combat prediction system, making you not only second guess what you're doing but possibly enable you to make the wrong decision this turn and costing you the entire run.

With that being said, I think this is a great game with a lot of potential, and could be considered one of the best indie roguelike strategy games to date when its all said and done. But I think not releasing this game in EA is doing itself a disservice as well as to the consumer, and I have problems recommending it because I feel I need to include a disclaimer beforehand. If you are a big fan of these games and don't mind maybe 75% of a full experience, I say you'll enjoy it and to give it a go as is. If you are on the fence, I think it would be wise to wait or buy on sale.

82599739,english,"I can't get enough of this game! I am a big fan of RPG's in general, I like the grind, leveling units, making them awesome. What I don't like so much, is grinding out those levels, especially if the grinding is boring and uninteresting. Star Renegades, took the RPG idea and turned it into a roguelite.

This game has fantastic turn-based combat with quite a bit of depth. I have yet to get bored of any battle in this game. Every single battle feels meaningful, and you almost always gain something important with every encounter. That, is fantastic design to me!

The story I found was mediocre, though I didn't mind it., it kept me engaged, and the final boss was super close and tense for me, I was at the edge of my seat during it! It is very short however, my first play through only took around 6 hours to complete. However, this game is made with a tremendous amount of repeat play through potential in mind. Though there is far less story involved with subsequent play throughs and it focuses mostly on the game play experience.

The graphics are absolutely beautiful for the style it's going for, and I really liked them! If your not a fan of spite-based games then the graphics probably won't be your cup of tea. I thought the animations were extremely well done, and I can really ""feel"" the impact of the abilities the characters use in combat.

The sounds and soundtrack are amazing as well. They did a great job with the sound effects in particular. They fit what is happening on screen so well and it adds so much enjoyment to the combat! I have also found myself pulling up a playlist of their soundtracks, because they are very catchy, and great to listen too. The sound team did an absolutely stunning job!

With how great this game feels to replay, I don't think i'll stop playing it anytime soon, and with the brand new update release, there is even more to do on subsequent play throughs!

82534634,english,"Star Renegades has a few missteps, but on a whole I really like the package it provides.

At its best, I am sitting here trying to figure out how to avoid complete disaster as I ponder how to best use each of the party’s special abilities. Do I accept the brutal hit in exchange for killing a guy? Do I taunt/redirect the hit to someone else who might not be in all that better of a state after taking the damage? Do I use my extremely limited stun action now to avoid major damage or save it for when I might be unable to mitigate it at all? Do I enrage a boss by using the wrong ability on it just give myself a moment’s respite in hopes that I can kill him next turn?

I really like trying to answer these questions and it is perhaps why I like playing this game so much. With the game being so openly deterministic, it makes it relatively easy to plan out your turn. The planning aspect does fall apart, perhaps intentionally so, when you need to consider instant actions (that you can’t undo) or special effects (that might make them take more damage for your party members that attack after they apply it)… but you can still try to plot out how it might all work out.

The game’s visual design is great. I really do like how it looks in the combat and all the various animations your party members have.

But as I said, there are some missteps. The game steals Middle Earth Shadow of War’s Nemesis’ system, a system which really should be in more games, yet it only feels functional rather than an improvement on it. Or how navigating the gorgeous map can be a little frustrating, especially if you are trying to go from one end to another. You can also get stuck on the pathfinding… its telling that they have a “Reset Location” button just to let you fix the pathfinding.

I also feel like there is a mismatch between the opening cinematic and the game in that I expected more resolution about this by the end, but whatever. Unless its hidden away after beating the game enough times or on a high enough difficulty.

In between each run you can spend some resources on upgrades, but you aren’t really getting much additive bonuses, mostly sidegrades or a larger pool of items. The one thing I wish persisted between runs is the relationships you can build up with each of the characters. I’d like to see all the dialog between them, but not if I need max it out on a single run. It would also make it a lot easier to unlock the new characters as well.

But the thing I feel like I dislike the most is just how long each run is. Yes you kind of need that slow progression to a full team, but feels like after the first run they could just cut out the first level before you camp the first time. And once you are at a full party, you are often fighting another full party of enemies which makes for longer fights.

So even if I’d like to play some more just to see all the characters, see how far I can push the difficulty, or get my revenge on that OP Crusader boss who haunts me, I think I had enough of the game for now.

Good visuals, strategic depth, feebacks and replay value. Worst (and only) real problem is that the interface is a bit hard to read sometimes in combat.
Overall a good rogue-like turn-based rpg, mostly because it is a very good turn-based rpg in the first place.

-Visuals, sound effect and animations are awesome
-Gameplay is original (at least for me) and strategic
-Changing team composition changes a lot how you will resolve fights, bringing good replay value
-Difficulty balance (on normal) is great. Challenging enough for you to wonder if you will beat this boss and finish it in glory with half your team downed, or die on the edge of victory with the boss now chilling at 10%hp
-Visuals again. Yes, they are really stunning

[b]What I like[/b]
-Music is nice
-Story is mostly a reason to go punch the badies (but with some twists and revelations tha unfold along the way)
-The light tone of the universe

[b]What I don't like[/b]

I love lots of things about this game, especially the combat system and turn-system, which really rewards planning and skill. The art style is your basic pixel style but it's very well done. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.

There are however a few things that I don't like about the game: No voice acting. No character creator. You move across the battlefield very linearly ie. you can just choose left or right and there's NO backtracking, so you literally lose out on resources depending on what path you choose (if they just allowed backtracking then I wouldn't knock the game for being so linear). The game would have been 'great' and not just 'good' imo if they remedied the above 'issues' but I doubt they would make such sweeping changes to the game at this stage.

So overall, is the game fun? Heck yeah. Is it worth $25? Yeah, sure.... but it's not the best thing since sliced bread.

（1）主c：幽灵、狙击手
（2）延缓手：破坏者、游击队员
（3）主t:神盾卫、主宰者
之后男女武神用起来都挺难用的，男武神好些嘲讽可以加减伤和反击还不消耗怒气，在低等级就有aoe可以反隐。女武神还是埋了吧。
能用高延缓就不要用低延缓浪费延缓次数（这是女武神难用的主要原因）
之后两个位置可以拿一个辅助，再拿一个延缓手，前排还需要一个副t（男武神、游击队员、瓦兰吉人）
执行者有就带上然后让他跟主c搞好关系，75关系加30%对标记伤害不是闹着玩的，当你的队伍缺少主c时他也可以当作主c来用
最好有一个位置对于护甲有很高的伤害
许多职业兼备多种功能
比如说神盾卫既是主t，又可以凭借等级4解锁的飞盾当副延缓手
幽灵不仅是主c，前期又可以凭借技能不错的延缓值当延缓手
打boss一定要注意单体技能让主t去吃，当他放aoe采取用高延缓技能对付他，或者用干扰打断他的行动。

对于游戏的建议：建议计算伤害时取消反击的伤害，由于小怪的高伤害，有时多挨一刀主t就抗崩了，而主t多吃一刀就是因为那个反击伤害，真没必要，能少吃刀就少吃刀
打第三个星球的boss计算伤害存在问题，除了第一回合的反刺甲形态，其他形态只反10点盾，和游戏中显示的完全反伤完全不一样。
期待游戏可以推出更多的新角色，然后枪手作为破坏者和游击队员的子嗣她的延缓咋就那么拉跨呢

81286057,english,"I highly recommend this game and will repeat what others have said.

Overall 4.5 out of 5 even though the below probably averages to less.

This is like Octopath Traveler with the break system with roguelite/like elements.  It is a roguelite RPG/Tactical game.  I would argue that the game’s difficulty is very reasonable.  HOWEVER, this is a genre that I especially like and can think through.  So difficulty can’t be quite compared Dead Cells(never got passed boss cell 1) or FTL or Hades or even Slay the Spire.  You have to figure out for yourself if you are good at these genres.  With that said, I think if given enough effort/though,  anyone can beat this.

Replayability –  3.5
To me, this game is very replayable.  It comes from the fact that you are gaining new characters to test different combinations.  The enemies however, aren’t all that variable, and the overall map doesn’t quite change (you will always go through the same worlds in the same order, but with slight differences in the map) However, I have high hopes for new patches to add variety.  
My only gripe is that the unlocks need to be AT LEAST half of the requirement of what it is now.  After 4-5 runs, I feel I have exhausted the games novelty.  I still play it, but I have yet to unlock 80 percent of the content.  The progeny requirement needs to be significantly lowered.  There are way too many progenies. And not everyone is going to play through enough times to unlock nearly everything.

Progression – 3.5 to 4.0
Characters/classes: The way this game progresses is by unlocking new character classes and variations on classes you already have. There are unlocks with equipment and droid bonuses.  The issue here is that most of the variations on the progenies aren’t very good.  They are different, and often times they aren’t better.  However, unlocking new CLASSES is very fun and interesting, and they often add a different play style.

Equipment: As someone pointed out, the issues with unlock equipment like dead cells is, there are a lot of crappy equipment out there, and it dilutes to have a focused strategy. I’ll explain in balancing below.  But unlocking selected equipment definitely makes the run easier.

unlock bonuses:
A lot of people complain that there isn’t progression in between runs.  That is true.  But at the same time, the game isn’t difficult that this is needed. HOWEVER, I would still love to seem some more progression for playing.  You are able to select a bonus at the start of each campaign, and unlock additional bonuses.  However, some of the bonuses are laughable.  Still this aspect doesn’t bother me at all compared to how much it bothers other people. Unlocking classes is great. But the variation on classes aren't noticeably beneficial.

Balancing 3.0
As someone pointed out, the issues with unlock equipment like dead cells is, there are a lot of crappy equipment out there, and it dilutes to have a focused strategy.  RNG is such that, I have a file with the best unlocks, and sometimes for example, I still won’t be offered a rifle for the entire game. I don't believe in nerfing the best items.  However, I do believe in making other equipment qualities more viable.  Right now, shield piercing and armor piercing, bleed/ and burn is still very week.  I think a tweak to improve blood and burn would be better. Armor piercing and shield piercing just needs to be doubled. It isn't enough that one character has it, because that means that other characters who don't have it will have to work through shields and armor.  
  
Classes:
I would say so far most characters and classes are very balanced.  There are many combinations to try. So I don’t have much to say here.

Story/character – 5
So, there isn’t much of a story here. But I am a guy who really hated games like Divinity 2(I thought the story was awful).  This game doesn’t try. Instead, it gives you a basic premise and sends you on your way immediately. No fuss. No pseudo philosophical crap. No “Complicated decisions that actually aren’t very meaningful”. No convoluted plotlines.  Where this game resonates with me is its humor.  Each character has a defining personality and some of the conversations are just so quirky, I just love it.  There are some hints of cynicism about our real world which I love as well.

The combat system is super good, the card sysem is supergood, all skills are useful. 

Its a damn good little game that deserves attention

81238149,english,"I'm going to recommend Star Renegades because I played it for over 50 hours and had a good time, and that's a more than reasonable value for the price I paid. However, as someone who hasn't historically attached to the rogue-like genre, I do struggle with it a bit. I think it falls prey to the same traps that most games in its genre do. For example, it's light on story... which is too bad, because the gorgeous world and characters beg for further exploration. More importantly, once you've beat the game once (which I did almost immediately just due to dumb luck), subsequent replays simply aren't rewarding enough.

That being said, I ground through the game at least a few dozen times, winning and losing, over the course of 50 hours before having the epiphany that just because a game imagines itself to be infinitely re-playable, doesn't mean it actually is. That usually happens much sooner when I pick up a rogue-like. So it is a fun game. As I mentioned earlier, the art is gorgeous. The character progression through each run is great. The interstitial progression is lacking, but I did enjoy unlocking all of the characters. If you're a fan of the rogue-like genre, I think you'll like this one.",1606751393,1606751393,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197969076610,265,4,3221,0,3221,1605977081,,

81150897,english,"This game is instense. You build your own party (except the first run) and try to get combos working. Not only with the characters but also your gear. There are so many different combinations of things you can do and from what I have seen pretty much everything works.

So you explore a planet with 3 days to go before every stage boss and every day you get 3 encounters. You can pick your own way to go on the map but most of the time it feels like there is always just one way that is better than the others but that may be my opinion. The fights are intense as I started this review with and you try to minimize damage on you while maximizing damage on your enemies through a beautiful combat system that at first seem pretty complex. Every turn needs planning and acting acording to your enemies and just doing whatever without conciderations will kill you. Fast.

You gain DNA which is essenssialy XP but you choose who gets it so you can end your game with a few high level characters and a couple of low levels or spread it even. You get loot from chests spread around the map and through shops. In the shops you spend gold which is aquired from defeating enemies and some special encounters.

81085540,spanish,"A pesar de que el punto fuerte del juego son los combates y la mecánica de estos, nuestros propios personajes conseguirán un protagonismo considerable. Al inicio de nuestra partida tendremos la posibilidad de acudir a los combates con un trío de héroes, más conocidos como los Renegados, y a lo largo de nuestra aventura podremos ir reclutando más e incluso nos permitirán que se unan al combate hasta un número de seis, creando de esta manera un escuadrón. Todos ellos serán diferentes entre sí, con habilidades complementarias y movimientos únicos pertenecientes a su respectiva clase. En nuestro viaje nos moveremos en grupo por todo el mapa del mundo, combatiremos, subiremos de nivel y nos equiparemos armas y armaduras, pero tenemos que tener en cuenta que estamos ante un roguelite, por lo que todo el progreso que consigamos se reiniciará cuando volvamos a la base de los Renegados y saltemos a una nueva dimensión, es decir, a una nueva partida.

El combate que presenta Star Renegades es complejo y accesible al mismo tiempo. En un principio es bastante abrumador, hay muchas estadísticas, aspectos básicos y conceptos que aprender, pero una vez nos familiarizamos con todos estos elementos, el combate se convierte en un desafío dónde conseguiremos una victoria muy gratificante. Es un combate por turnos, pero se le considera determinista, dónde tendremos que estar atentos de un cronograma que muestra las acciones de los enemigos antes de que las lleven a cabo y, de esta forma, nosotros planear nuestra estrategia para acabar con ellos.

Todas las acciones aparecen en el cronograma en función del momento en que se vayan a realizar en el asalto, salvo las instantáneas. Cada asalto durará 60 segundos. Otro de los aspectos a tener en cuenta son las barras de estado de nuestros héroes: la del escudo, la vida y el blindaje. Es importante saber que los escudos se regeneran al final de cada combate, y el blindaje sólo podrá sufrir daño en el caso de que se elimine el escudo previamente. Sin embargo, tanto la vida como el blindaje se pueden reparar en el campamento mediante cartas o en el mundo con botiquines.

Sin duda, una de las características más brillantes y destacables del videojuego es particularmente su pixel art. Está completamente detallado y adornado con toques RPG y, permite que podamos disfrutar de un colorido mundo rodeados de pequeñas partículas. Todo ello lo sumamos a los combates, estos tienen un estilo visual muy bien diseñado, con un fondo desenfocado y una atención a los personajes que termina gustando mucho. Las animaciones son la punta del iceberg del gran trabajo que han hecho, consiguen llenarnos la pantalla de luz, color y vibración con toda la acción que intentan demostrar con cada habilidad.

En conclusión, Star Renegades se muestra como el típico RPG con toques roguelite que anima a ser probado por el diseño gráfico que tiene. Pero no nos equivoquemos, es un juego que va más allá presentando un estilo de combate de lo más original y fantástico, con un nivel de estrategia muy elevado y que nos permite lograr una buena experiencia en cada asalto. Sin embargo y pese a que seremos bastamente castigados si llegamos a fracasar y estamos casi al final, no importará todas las horas y tiempo que hayamos invertido en este juego, porque cada partida será diferente y mantendrá su esencia en todo momento. Si lo que buscas es un juego de estrategia con combates por turnos y que tenga toques RPG y de roguelite, no busques más porque este es el tuyo.

Gameplay is fun: simple enough yet in end up being challenging. Some sort of strategic roguelike. The combat timeline may take some time to master, but it is fun when you get it.  

Replay value is good: It IS the main plot of the game after all. If you are the kind to get bored quickly, you may find some redundance here and there but this attitude may lead to a quick death.

Graphics are nice for that sort of game.

Sound: not my cup of tea I guess. There is sound, and music. My ears didn't bleed. No masterpiece either but good enough.

Story: Take the story of FTL, double it....that's about it. You don't play this game for the story, you play for the challenge and the gameplay.

It has a great deal of fun or innovative mechanics.... but most of what it has is clutter and over-complicated trash that's too full of its own self-importance to have spent time making itself meaningful. It's nothing a complete balance overhaul couldn't fix, so long as they circular file all the trivial ""mechanics"" to focus on the important parts. And I do mean a [i]complete[/i] rework. Almost everything needs to be changed. That's what makes this so disappointing is that so much of what the game needs is there, but it's just too raw and too much crap that should have been cut from the final draft was kept in.

The most important feature this game has is a fast-forward button, because even the devs know how boring their game gets when you spend this much time watching their combat animations ""being cool"". 

Outside of that? There are some bugs and UI problems that, though minor, really should have been caught before this was released. The UI regularly interferes with your ability to navigate the game, and some enemies end up with such massive text walls of stats or buffs or abilities that you have to scroll just to inspect them all. Mechanical complexity is not how you make interesting or compelling opponents.

If I'm being charitable, maybe all of this is the result if inadequate play-testing and a rushed release because 2020 is the year that ruins everything for everyone (devs included). I see what they had hoped to make, and it would have been incredible. There's such an incredible amount of work that went into Star Renegades for them to be proud of, even if it ended up... well... here.

If I'm being honest, Star Renegades is my biggest disappointment of 2020. At least until November.

It does give me an even greater appreciation for [i]Into the Breach[/i] and [i]FTL[/i]. I love games where your choices matter. This isn't one of those. [b]But do buy the soundtrack. It's fantastic.[/b]

80734977,english,"One of the few games I played a lot in 2020 and didn't lost interest quickly. Initially I was interested because it was from the makers of Halcyon 6 and I expected something similar. But this game is quite different.

Still it is one of those very few games in which a lot things fit together that are important to me. It has good gameplay and a consistent art style in which visuals and music fit well together.

About the gameplay: it uses a turn-based and deterministic sytems which does not take too long and which can be accelarated. The rogue-like aspects work also very well, you progress further with every run by the right balance of playing better and transfer of advantages unlocked by previous runs.

About the visuals: some people don't like pixel art or other art constrained to a certain style. If you are one of them, this game might not be for you. To me it was always more important that a very good and consistent result is achieved within the given constraints, even when they are self-imposed. I never understood the praise for high resolution 3D-deserts of low detail are praised over low resolution 2D images with high detail. The art style keeps the same level of detail throughout the game, it does not decline over the course of the game.

76256667,english,"Star Renegades is even better than I thought it'd be.

Don't let the pixelated graphics (which I'm sure was a deliberate style choice) fool you. The animations are emphatic, the portraits are emotional and the sprites capture the energy of every character you can unlock.

You read that right. [b]Unlockable characters[/b] are abundant. You can unlock alternate versions of characters, discover new characters on your adventure, or raise the influence of two companions up enough that they create a progeny. There are so many different ways to get new characters, I'm still discovering them, so this review might not even list them all. It's fantastic.

And let's get down to the gameplay, shall we? This scratches my [b]turn-based RPG[/b] itch. I was thinking of picking up Final Fantasy X/X-2 on Steam and was just waiting for a Steam sale. Timeless classic, right? Well, one day, I restarted my computer, saw this Steam ad pop up for some RPG-ish thing that had some sort of weird ""Star Wars"" knock-off name, and hoo-boy! Did it deliver! I am more than 20 hours deep in this game and see no signs of stopping.

You can have 5-6 team members altogether (you start off with 3), and you have this nifty meter at the top of your screen that basically allows you to manipulate time. Well, not really, it allows you to manipulate the enemy, but you're pushing them ""back"" in time whenever you attack them (with most attacks, not all do), allowing members of your team to go first, and sometimes delaying an enemy's turn all the way into the next round. It's a neat mechanic that often reminds me of the aforementioned Final Fantasy X's turn-timer, except as you learn to play the game, you'll find that manipulating your enemies on each turn is actually way more important here in Star Renegades.

Which brings us to the difficulty. Star Renegades can be punishing, it can be frustrating, and if you screw up your manipulation of your foes (the manipulation is in the preceding paragraph, if you're skipping around) then that can cost you an unrecoverable amount of health. This game is not for pushovers. On a scale of Telltale to Dark Souls, I'd rate this game about 6-7 out of 10 in terms of difficulty. It's not likely to make you rage-quit, as you'll probably keep getting farther and farther as you replay the game, but it's not afraid of giving you the stick, either. It's also a rogue-like, so you're not likely to have the same exact run twice in a row, which of course subsequently increases or decreases your difficulty per run. You will find repeating maps, if you make enough runs, but the rewards, enemies, bosses and other secrets will often vary.

There are apparently some bugs in the game, but I have yet to encounter or recognize any. After 25 hours of gameplay, I'd say that's pretty decent.

Star Renegades, truly, is one of the best games I've ever played. Easily a top 10 game for me. This game is well worth the full price.

If you're like me and love games that involve a high degree of micromanaging, then you'll like it; otherwise, I suggest turning away. A a big fan of games like XCOM, this game was a treat to play. The unique timeline system, partnered with the challenging difficulty, makes every encounter a mental stress test. To put it into perspective, healing and armour are relatively hard to regenerate once lost in battle, as such, every encounter challenges the player to loose as little health and armour as possible, this becomes a real workout once enemy squads start utilizing particularly challenging formations. Buy this game if you want a unique take on turn based strategy, as well as being up for a challenge.

80472041,english,"Star Renegades is a game that knows what it wants to be, and it's highly respectful of your time and attention to the details. It sells a fresh take on old-fashioned turn-based RPG's with both its battle system, and an intriguing mix-up with the roguelike mechanics that allow you to choose from over a dozen different heroes to bring along on each run. Each of them feels truly unique, rather than just being another stat-block. You can have the Saboteur who is fast and great at stunning and staggering opponents, while also being able to use explosives for AoE attacks or disrupt enemies prepared to counter-attack. The Marksman is perfect for sniping those in the back row, since Star Renegades uses a positional system where front row enemies must die first, but he can also melt through armor, provide cover fire, and assist other allies with damage multipliers on tough single foes.

All this occurs with the backdrop of the game's unique Stagger and Break system. All combat occurs on a 60 point ""timer"", and all actions have a time cost. Enemies' actions are always queued at the start of each round, allowing you to then choose your actions accordingly to defend, counter, or disrupt the enemy's plan. If attacks come right on or before an enemy's move, you score a Critical, and the enemy may be Staggered, which delays their move in the timeline -- and if you push them right off the edge of the bar, that triggers a Break, which prevents them from acting that turn at all! However, the enemy will re-queue that exact same action on the same target(s) in the very next round. Every stagger you inflict cuts into each enemy's Stagger Limit, and if it reaches 0, they can't be staggered at all until they take their action, which raises the limit once more. This creates a delicate tactical setup where you have to time your moves properly, and trigger Breaks smartly so that you'll be able to continue the assault in the coming rounds.

They really aren't kidding about establishing relationships between party members, either, which is done primarily through a system that feels like a mix of Darkest Dungeon's camping and Fire Emblem's support conversations -- and you had better do this, too, because life's gonna be a Bad Time™ without the game-winning combo attacks & support maneuvers you can unlock. The last two people to deal finishing damage to a Lieutenant-class or higher ranked enemy will get a special card that gives free relationship points, as well, which encourages the player to try and game their fights so that those they want to rank up in relationships get kills.

Now, I do have some critical points. The game structure is roughly static for each run, divided into 'missions' where you choose points on the map to liberate and fight enemies. Occasionally you can also find a side dungeon to delve into for extra level-ups, items & bonuses. It's neat, but it doesn't yet have enough variation or mutators that would keep me engaged for more. That said, the devs have already explicitly laid out in their roadmap that they're going to add new worlds and elements for this later on, so I hardly consider this a black mark on the game at all. I mean, I've done a hat trick, 3 runs played (and won in a row) already as of this review, in escalating difficulty levels, and I still feel like I want to come back just to try unlocking new heroes and seeing what other combos and legendary loot there is to unlock!

So yeah. Just to summarize, this game's got me hooked, and I was kind of blown away to discover it was only released like 2 months ago as of this review. Major content updates seem to come regularly, and I can tell this team knows what they're doing. The game is great even as is, and I can't wait to see more, because already I love how much it respects me as a player and truly challenges me to be at my best, while still throwing in plenty of curveballs now and then to keep things interesting. 9/10, buy it now!",1606429580,1606429580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197995260060,84,20,3553,0,2414,1608694747,,

Who the hell like picking ""renegades"" that are useless, scale horribly, and/or rely on said loot box mechanics?
Who the hell likes wasting their time at the whims of loot boxes?
Well if you are this type of garbage person, then this game is for you!

great game, that makes me hate how poorly developed the mechanics are. I dont want to do research on games or waste hours on trial and error... but I did do research and my confusion was real, some of these characters are WORTHLESS, when they shouldn't be, easily couldn't be!

For instance- this moronic ""renegade"" heals for 50 at level 1, where all damages are 20-30. great. So at level 10 where all damages are 100-200.. how much does this healer heal? 50. Unless you get unrelated loot box luck.


In a nutshell this game batters your frustration impulse to form a sense of accomplishment if you suffer through the trial and error. I know frustration is the most base level of stimulation, but for those who like to enjoy their time, and not get delusional senses of accomplishment after overcoming wall after contrived wall, I cannot recommend. I cannot imagine playing this game not in the background while not doing something else.

First of all, to unlock new renegades you have to play cards with specific ones(the ones who have 4 hearts with eachother) at camp: That wasn't initially clear to me. Essentially you make them fall in love and bang out some new progeny. 

I wish you didnt start over at level 1, level 1 is boooorrring; this could have been mitigated with those unlockable weapons being ok.. but they are crap.

I really like this game, but it is horrible right now. This games concept is really fun, I play it in the background while i do other things... but there are GLARING, GAMEBREAKING issues that make this game BROKEN

This game uses more CPU. and GPU than most 3D games, poorly optimized? something clandestine going on in the background? I dont know.

MOST ""renegades"" are USELESS and pale in comparison to others. I spent hours confused on what I was doing wrong, but then i looked to online and it turns out most of them are just awful and then scale even worse.

after space elevator the game has locked up many times on me - not too bad the saving in this game is good. just have to alt+f4 and restart a few seconds behind.


So these are the small issues, annoying nonetheless:
-Random loot box mechanic - blah
-DNA cashes on world 3 with 2 DNA - insulting
-The main renegade you start with/is in ""story"" is garbage - embarrassing for dev team; are you guys dumb?
-random crazy power spikes in enemies (like 100x harder from room to room)
-enemies become impervious to stagger - its just stupid, but would be ok if the renegade design was decent.

great concept, horrible execution, they say they will patch it, but it looks like  so far instead of buffing worthless renegades, they are nerfing the strong ones... fingers crossed.

I was really confused why I couldnt figure this game out... and then i looked at all the YouTube people who have ""beat"" this game and they have confirmed all this stuff above... kinda bitter i wasted my time figuring out a rigged rubiks cube",1599971481,1606365801,False,1,0,0.42907559871673584,0,True,False,False,76561198077885979,75,24,6628,0,688,1609650300,,

75661724,english,"Okay, i'm not sure why the devs calls ""Star Renegades"" an ""JRPG"", but whatever.

This game is a HARDCORE ROGUELIKE turn-based RPG with an amazing tactical battle system and tricky (RAGE INCLUDING) boss battles. 

TL;DR ""Star Renegade"" is 
NOT
A
CASUAL
GAME
AT ALL

The devs managed to create a really deep and balanced (not ideal, but hey, it's working)  battle system, that rely on your tactical decisions and not stupid RNG. (HELLO, DARKEST DUNGEONS!)
This game will test your brain functions and the ability to think & create diversive teams/setups. 

[h1][b]The Story[/b][/h1]
Well, not the strongest part of the game, since it's a roguelike. 
An unknown alien force from another/alternative reality/galaxy attacked your world, killing your family member during the tutorial sequence. Now it's up to you to fight off the invaders or face total annihilation. The story plot is alright and serve it's main purpose.

[h1][b]The Gameplay[/b][/h1]
This is the part of the game, that will keep you focused and, sometimes, triggered. Like my soft spot started burning at a second major boss fight with ""Chimera""-like creature.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2223424671 
Tutorial in this game is pretty good, so there's no need for me to deep dive into the gameplay mechanics, but i must say that the game get progressively harder as you progress through the planets. Adding more complex enemies, which got a hell of a ton different abilities, that they absolutely love to throw at your sorry ***.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2224199394 
Previously, i said that this game is better, compared to heavy RNG roguelike games like Darkest Dungeon. The main reason for that is -> the battle system is heavily based around your own decisions and not cheap RNG mechanics like Accuracy, Evasion, %Chancesomething, etc. 

The second important RNG part is drop from Chests and loot available at merchants. But since you can choose 1 out of 3 (from chests) and even more at merchants (cost credits), usually there's always something worth to pick up.

Aside from credits(money) and equipment drop, you also need to decide who you will level up. This is pretty important when you face the toughest challenges, like Behemoths. For example, when i faced Behemoth #2, i would've 100% wiped there if i didn't leveled my Aegis to level 6 and gained her ""Fortress"" skill (AoE party shield, she takes all damage, instead of your other party members). But this was purely luck and i'm sure that without experience/knowledge wipes are inevitable.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2223424533 
One of the most important mechanics you need to carefully check is ""Enrage"".
As you can see in the screenshot, if my Mr.Robot attacked that party with AoE attack, it will trigger the elite officer ""Enrage"" status and trust me - you don't want that to trigger for any enemy. If you trigger it -> usually, it will be something like Stats buff + Ultimate attack next turn. Ignore Enrage only if you're going for a kill OR you plan to CC your target with STUN next turn and FINISH them off during that turn, otherwise the enemy will still launch an ultimate attack 2 turns later.

Chaining CC(crowd-control) against single strong officers/bosses is a good tactic, for example you can go BREAK-BREAK-STUN-STUN or BREAK-STUN-STUN or BREAK-STUN-BREAK-STUN, this is only examples and you need to adjust it manually each time you fight. There's a lot of enemies that will not allow you to BREAK them 2 times in a row (but there's some exceptions). 
Though, BREAK-STUN-STUN will work on 95% targets, but it also costs a lot of ""Fury points"" and for you to do that you'l also need to level up friendship with the Wanna-be-Chris-Redfield.

Overall, the battle system is really fun & engaging.

[h1][b]The Final Verdict
8/10[/b][/h1]
A hidden gem of the roguelike genre with one of the best battle systems out there.

79742135,schinese,"全角色解锁，物有所值。不过目前的完成度仅限于通关2-3次，不是回合制肉鸽的死忠粉建议等以后多更新点怪和BOSS后再入手。评论里有些DISS天骄客吹捧他姐的老哥属于误导新人，首先这两角色就不应该出现在先发阵容（除非刷解锁），而后续出现这两人二选一的话，明显天骄客的价值明显更大，升到四级出个嘲讽就能当T了，而他姐如果不是重点培养的话基本干啥啥不行。
目前角色数量不多，而且平衡不算很好，有些阵容拿出来就是整活的，就算侥幸通过第一关后面的奇美拉也教你做人，以下是我认为的角色分级，仅针对开局选人，之后阵容需要看具体缺什么：
T0：执政官（全场唯一奶妈，普通难度以上每局必选，否则奇美拉给你死，其他角色的回盾技能都是来整活的，除此绝活之外竟然还有全场最快的AOE打断技，配上合适装备和强AOE角色之后可以一回合清场）
T1：幽灵（狙击手和超感萝莉解锁，高打断高AOE双武器槽高伤切后排，最强主C没有之一）
T2：瓦兰吉人（女武神和奶妈解锁，高破甲双武器槽高伤强AOE，身板一般），双枪男破坏者（最强控场，就是伤害拉胯不能当C），游击队员双枪机器人（真正的万金油，双武器高伤高打断伪AOE，竟然还能客串前排），盾女（全游制定主T）

TL;DR: Great potential. Still a recommend grab if INCREDIBLY BAD tutorials and late-game enemies with cheap tricks don't bother you, or if the aesthetics please you. Just be mindful that there are flashing lights and no accessibility option around them.

For a rogue-like game, where trying and making mistakes are the main learning part, to have a tutorial THAT MUCH BAD is a design flaw, not just a ""tutorials are hard, majority of the industry is bad at doing them anyway"". Worse part is that there is a specific video on the front page designed to tell you how much tactical the combat is and how much there is to learn while playing. Then, the game front-loads EVERYTHING at your face on the tutorial, in the most confusing way possible. I wish I could tell you ""just skip the tutorial"", but the start of the story is there, so you're stuck with it.

Over time, you learn that one of the main parts of combat is managing timings on actions in ways that favors you, which creates a side-challenge along simply clearing the combat that is interesting and challenging. The not really helpful way the game found of showing the results of the action you're about to select is to switch between the current state and the results on the health/shield bars. Problem is, that is only for involved characters (on some occasions, group attacks change that a bit). Trying to see the results of actions that affects your whole team is downright impossible sometimes. With experience you get to understand better and get a hold of the system. That is, until it fails you.

If an enemy is being killed before his action by your actions already queued up, you still see the effects of that killed enemy actions on your previews. So, you might be seeing a ""Late Kill"" warning on someone on your team, but the turn WILL resolve in a way that the character won't actually die because one of the sources of damage will be removed. Or that character might die anyways. But you'll have no option to know for sure, except from knowing the attacks and how much damage each does, but that comes from experience. And it's not only that. For example, one of your characters can guard other people on your team for damage, taking it herself in their stead. But if you're guarding an ally that will attack an enemy that counters, she still takes the damage, but the battle preview will say otherwise. There are so many interesting mechanics that interact between each other and gives this game a great depth. But if you want to test them, be ready to fight against all those problems AND the UI. Because talk about one thing that didn't went through a lot of thought. Just see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2295257875]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2295257875[/url].

But lets say you like these challenges. You dredge through bad UI and unhelpful previsions. You create a team with great synergy, with a sound strategy for battling on several different situations. You go and get to the last mission... and it's an escort mission. A ""character"" is added to your team, and it's GAME OVER if that character dies (restart run, since it's a rogue-like). And since you can't select the escort during battles, you can't predict how much damage it'll be taking during engagements. If you don't have options to defend it, the run is over. But let's say you still do. And you go and defeat the last boss!

But now comes the plot-twist boss! And the plot-twist boss CHEATS! Since you've became able to look at enemy actions to know how to strategize, this boss has some actions that don't appear on the timeline AT ALL. Have that once-per-battle interruption you were saving for a moment of crisis? USELESS. Oh, and the boss can also ignore guard-ally mechanics, meaning your escort is vulnerable to the plot-twist boss as soon as it decides it wants to end your run.

Fun times.

(still got a lot of progress, since it was just my second run. But that felt cheap like sheet)

I don't see the devs being able to put enough work to review the preview system AND making a better tutorial.

79586825,english,"Great combat system. Trying to make a team works is really fun.

Not sure about the roguelike/replayability aspect as i have only completed 2 playthroughs, and there does not seem to have too many random elements that have a big enough impact to make you change your decision.
For example, the skills/cards you get from upgrading a class are fixed, which means that a Lv 10 Valkyrie is always the same as the other Lv 10 Valkyrie you got in another run. While there are equipment and relationships with other members that affect a bit, it doesn't really differ too much.

That said, with the excellent battle system, simply replaying the game with different team composition itself is already very satisfying.

My complains are mostly about the QoL stuff - UI and the controls. 
Essential information is sometimes not well displayed or hard to find and the UI is quite busy. (Especially when there are 5+ units, it's really hard to click on a specific target)
Moving in the field feels slow and clunky.
Some really frequently used features do NOT have keyboard hotkeys - selecting a skill and selecting a target.
While the speed up option is nice for repeated playthroughs, the screen is zooming in and out and it feels a bit dizzy.

79577825,english,"Was obsessed when I first got it, but I finally beat it and now I super don't care. I'd tend to agree with reviewers saying there's a lack of replayability. Bosses are always the same. Enemies are generally the same stock run-to-run. So many characters and variants, but you're likely to use very similar comps every run because there's a limit to how much you can stagger any enemy, which discourages AOE attacks as well, so what are you going to do? You tank. And there are like only two tanks. And one of them is much, much, MUCH better than the other, so you're always going to use the Juggernaut. So much equipment, but even if you go HAM and blitzkreig through elites to get free equipment drops, you're somewhat unlikely to equip everyone fully in a playthrough. And that's if you're even offered stuff that goes with your party; decent chance you won't be (I know there's a mechanic to mitigate this; the fact that they needed a mechanic to deal with it should've made the light bulb go on over someone's head and say ""hey, you think we're putting too much meaningless shit in this game?"").

Now, why did I stick with it that long? The strategic, turn-based core gameplay is super engaging. Again, I find it doesn't encourage team diversity, and it definitely can't hide the fact that this shouldn't have been a goddamned roguelike. There's clearly scaffolding and content for an entire traditional 20+ hour JRPG and, with the grand galactic tale they're always paying lip-service to, it would've been much more interesting seeing it unfold that way.

79550254,english,"Idea doesn't sound bad on paper, but feels lacking in execution.

Essentially it's a rougelike where one run consists of beating 4 'planets'. Each planet has a map (that may or may not be procedurally generated), with a set of rooms you can fully inspect the moment you arrive. However, despite technically allowing you to check all information, doing so would be an utter chore at best, in between scrolling about, hovering over enemy types and trying to find which room has a connection to which. Compared to, i.e. Slay the Spire or Darkest Dungeon, the map is just needlessly 'graphic'd up' instead of providing accessible functionality.

To add more to the 'look at this useless gimmick!' column, navigation on the map is done in oldschool RPG fashion, by leading a pixelated party across the surface... but given each room has clearly defined exit points that need to be clicked to enter the next room, and the rooms are perfectly empty exact for the combat (that starts automatically) and whatever single loot drop it may contain, this isn't so much a feature as a chore. 
This becomes even more apparent when night drops and you sometimes have random additional loot drops spawn... scattered across the map... which will take you a minute or two of navigating just to click on a room, wait for the movement animation, click the next room, etc, until finally reaching those couple coins to pick up. Whoever thought this was a reasonable use of the player's time should try applying to EA or Actiblizzard, you would fit right in.

Moving on, each of these maps comes with 3 days, in which you can each access 3 rooms, from which most, but not all, contain combat encounters. If there's any kind of event encounters of actual gameplay relevance (beyond picking up randomized loot or a small boost to shield/armor) I have not seen them, though occasionally you get interactable spots that give you 2 lines of text that I assume to were attempts of witty banter character building.  In between those days you get to camp (think Darkest Dungeon), whilst managing a combination of exhaustible cards, buffs, healing and a companionship mechanic that allows your characters to give the same buff in a stacking variety to his various teammates. It's a nice touch, but I'm honestly disappointed at the fact each character seems to have like 3 text blurps with semi-appropriate 'thank you for the gift' context. Hades probably spoiled me there.

But, all those nuances aside, let's get to the core gameplay of tactical combat:

The idea of having a mix of instant actions and otherwise a timeline-based combined initiative (aka, both sides plan their turns, and the resolution of the turn depends on who goes when with which move to do what) is actually quite a nice concept and gives the fights a properly interesting puzzle-esque feel. I as well like the proper application of apriori-RNG (the enemy actions are randomized, but are visible to you, allowing you to build your tactic around the randomly generated situation, each turn. But once you make a decision, there's no RNG after that in form of hit/miss/crit mechanics).

As well, each character has a bit of his niche, with damage dealers, tanks, support mages, etc, bringing varied abilities.

And yet... combat gets incredibly dull after barely 4 hours. Once you figure out how to 'break' enemies by staggering them enough, how the stagger limit works, what the few different enemy types can do... combat becomes pretty formulaic.

So, what about that ""Intelligent Adversary"" system, that creates new, 'unique' enemies to 'counter your strategys'?
Seriously?
It's the weakest possible implementation of a Nemesis-System I've seen to this day. Think of Shadow of Mordor, but then replace all the ork captains with recolors, all their voice lines with the same ever-repeating ~3 text blurbs (yes, you will have notable repetition just by combating them once). Gameplay wise, they're just beefed up regular enemies with occasional access to a special move and a shit ton of randomly assorted modifiers that don't affect gameplay all that relevantly. So what if the enemy takes less damage from heavy attacks? If I stagger him, which you should always do anyways, my heavy attacks will STILL be the most logical option, by virtue of dealing more damage than the light can, even despite the resistance. Oh, so he uses damage type A instead of damage type B? Well, good thing there's a dozen different damage types that are almost indistinguishable, so the chance for one of your characters to run into an issue is pretty slim. 
And it does not help that, within a single run, fighting... 12? of these enemies, one of their 'personalities' was already repeated, speaking for a.. questionable lack of variety implemented.

Which loops right back around to the combat animations. Every character appears to have ~20 different sprites, with the same animations being repeatedly reused for the various different moves and attacks, at times simply switching up the order of the animations or mirroring them. I felt like playing a fan-mod of Little Fighter II, we used to excessively re-use sprites that way, too, because the best we had to make them was no experience and MS Paint.

Summary: No. Some concepts are nice, but the overall gameplay loop gets stale incredibly fast, and if there's any meaningful depth in the game, it seems to elude me, to such a massive degree that I can't even get myself to try a second run with the newly unlocked characters.",1605873423,1605873423,False,41,1,0.581373870372772217,0,True,False,False,76561198003880852,515,135,276,0,267,1605916434,,

79483582,english,"Star Renegades is quite an impressive combination of strategy, RPG and rogue-lite elements, at least for one playthrough. Once you’ve learnt the basics and you’ve reached a certain point, there’s an option to continue with one of four difficulties, meaning gamers playing more for the RPG and a little light strategy can enjoy it just as much as those wanting a more challenging experience.

The story was nothing amazing to be quite honest. You’re basically fighting off invading enemies on a few different planets, trying to work your way up to the big dog. While the story was pretty basic, the character dialogue was often amusing, in that lame and cheesy way I love so much! The conversations unlocked upon increasing relationships between characters were some of my favourites. The soundtrack and sound effects were both awesome too, and fit well with the general theme of Star Renegades.

The gameplay was pretty interesting and well thought out for the most part. On the map phase of Star Renegades, you travel through different areas, of which you have a choice of a few different routes to take. I often spent a little time examining the map and planning my route so I could destroy all the commanders and loot as many weapon caches as possible before finally taking on the Behemoth. You’ll also be able to camp at certain stages. This is where you can apply the camping cards for specific benefits during the next couple of battles. This will also help increase your character’s relationships with one another, unlocking new perks, combo attacks, as well as new playable characters (progenies). I don’t know how many unlockable characters there are, but I imagine you’ll need to play through many times to have any chance of unlocking them all.

The combat is where I’d say the game excels. At its core, the combat uses a turn based system that many gamers will be familiar with, but there’s much more to it than you might first expect, and it often requires some decent strategy, especially as you progress on higher difficulties. Naturally, you have a certain amount of health for each character, but you also have armour and shields. Shields will automatically replenish at the end of each battle, but armour and health won’t. This makes every battle pretty intense! There’s also a visual display of when each character will attack, depending on the requirements of the actions being taken. Certain attacks can delay enemies. Delay them enough you’ll “break” them, preventing them attacking until the next round. This became a particularly vital aspect to master and take full advantage during my playthrough. Perfectly timed delays, breaks, and stuns became integral for my success, as did knowing when to hold my attacks and focus on defending instead. If one of your characters happens to die in battle, they’ll be brought back to life once the battle is over, but with a negative effect for the rest of the playthrough. If all your characters die, you’ll have to start from the beginning again. Levels, equipment, relationships, they’ll all be reset. You will, however, keep any intel from defeating commanders and tech points to use for upgrades in between runs.

Unlike many RPGs, you don’t earn experience at the end of a battle, at least not in the usual sense. Instead, you gain DNA, which can be used to level up any of your characters at your own choosing. Each character level will improve their health, allow them to equip better equipment, and unlock a new camping card or combat action/attack. It may be the case that you want to level up a specific character before the others because of the cards or attacks available to them, or maybe because you just found an awesome weapon and they need to a higher level to use. It’s yet another aspect that requires the user to think about, and I loved it!

Once you fail or finish a run, you’ll go to a central hub/base where you can use intel points to unlock different characters to have in your party and your tech points to unlock equipment that can be found during each playthrough. You’ll also be able to upgrade the droid that accompanies and revives your dead characters, but only one upgrade can be active at a time. I found the 50% armour repairs when camping to be particularly useful! The main downside I found with Star Renegades is that it doesn’t have much replayability after the first successful run. Sure, you can play to unlock new characters, equipment and droid upgrades, but the gameplay and battles aren’t varied enough to make it interesting or worthwhile for further playthroughs.

Overall, Star Renegades is a pretty great game! There’s a whole load of different aspects to think about while playing, and different approaches to combat and traversing through each world, along with a multitude of equipment, upgrades, and unlockables. The story is mediocre, but the dialogue entertaining. The main aspect that lets it down is the lack of variation in each run. Other than using different characters and working towards unlocking new characters and upgrades, there’s no big difference in the gameplay or combat. I failed on my initial playthrough, but completed the game on my second run and didn’t have much of an urge to play again, other than to record some gameplay footage. It was still well worth a play, and I have no doubt there are people out there who would happily replay the game a few more times at least.

感觉 三人组加神盾的组合比较万金油，都不掉血的，随便再加个输出，最好是能破甲的，后面的图一堆的甲，尤其是boss。
炒鸡好用的组合技---->灾变，不管道中还是精英怪，上去埋个雷，执行官一发释能，加上七七八八的延缓，第二回合引爆雷，加上灾变，基本小怪就莫得了，剩下的就是单挑。
神盾专门替队友挡伤害六级就行了，女武神和半路拉入伙的输出升满，执行官升八出群盾技能，剩下的就随意了。

【对新入坑的老哥老姐一些小提示，都是些玩过上过一遍就能知道的小东西】
每个图最好把三个精英都打了，挺吃装备的这游戏。其次就是摸摸甲和盾，要是不想把卡浪费在回血上，就留个血包到最后。
第二个星球的boss战只有boss一个，甲多，尽量不要眩晕干扰，不会中途召马仔。第三个星球的boss是个上百甲巨厚的盾怪，所以一定要有破甲佬。飞船战，卡片基本可以随便选了，尤其是那些只限两场战斗的，人一共四场战斗，前两场都是马仔，简直恶意满满，，第三场是boss的看门精英怪，到达此处的路有三条，建议选带装备的，觉得不稳可以走血甲盾的路（虽然马仔关一般不会掉血就是了）。boss战最坑，千万不要随意把组合技全交关，一阶段，一共会召两轮小怪，每轮各两个，第一轮的很脆，第二轮的很肉还都是范围攻击。boss死掉后还会有第二阶段，第二阶段跑出来个培养皿，会把boss以某种程度再召唤出来，这时候有个巨坑，即使再次打死boss，培养皿只要还在，就会再召出来（到处都是雷等着你踩啊有没有~！），所以要优先切死培养皿，有能切后排的技能最好，不然就得范围攻击一点点的蹭。。最后一关建议堆血量，boss有个技能是可以穿盾穿甲的真伤，满盾流血死就尴尬了。。

陆陆续续玩了好长时间（从不跳过战斗时间），刚出的时候功能还没那么完善，每隔一段时间上线都能发现确实是越来越方便了，人性化了许多，特别是最近更新的在巨兽点出了个解锁机，可以把锁上的图都解开，这要搁以前，妥妥的漏上几场战斗的经验。。可以算得上死吃了点版本福利？？

There might be a reality out there in which I don’t like Star Renegades. This version of me does not live in that reality.
But does it accomplish universal fun?
Let’s break it down…

[b]Visuals&UI[/b]

Non-combat UI is well integrated and easy on the eyes, not cluttered, but it needs a bit of orientation to know what’s what. Some information is hard to find or absent (e.g. perpetual buffs, relationship buffs). 
Combat UI is thorough and sensible. It tends to get cluttered and noisy in late game, when more characters are on the board and lots of AoE become part of the battle routine. Separating different Overwatch and Counter effects also requires some detective work, as the Fluff name of some abilities is counterintuitive to what the executed ability actually does in the context of the game.

Enough with the boring nonsense, we all know why we're in this section:
The. Visuals. Are. Gorgeous. 
The attention to detail, how Star Renegades ‘fools’ your eyes in the most positive sense, is stellar.
If you love to see pixel art done right you should have a field day. The character design is memorable and creative, integrates well with gameplay and backgrounds are stunning.
The best I can do to describe the artstyle is that it makes you ‘hungry’, you constantly want to see more of it, hunt for little details hidden in what seems to be so simple, yet is not.
I’m now 30 hours in and I haven’t skipped a single animation, because yes, they’re that charming.There’s distinct animations for attacks, hits, exhaust states, guarded states and they all translate incredibly as exciting, fun expressions of how these characters would fight.
It baffles me that combo attacks do not have their own animation. I understand the constraints of Indie Development, but that just seems like a big missed opportunity to add more charm to the game, as the visuals are the heart and connective tissue of the whole thing.
II also noticed some slight quality differences or odd choices. The Marksman character twirling his damn rifle in Sniper Mode drove me insane and actually kept me from using it, and some executions seem .5 seconds too long compared to more snappy moves (Looking at you Man-O-War).

[b]Sound[/b] 

So if my eyes are in a constant state of bliss with this, what about the ears?
SFX synergize well with gameplay and art and have the right amount of impact. Attacks don’t feel weak or whiffy. If you give a giant Cyborg cat an uppercut or mind-shank a Rocket Techno Warlock, it exactly sounds like you would imagine.
Star Renegades’ Soundtrack has some good variety, though with diminishing returns. It’s a solid mix of pumpy sci-fi neo synth and spacey bloinks and bleeps. 

[b]Story[/b] 


In a universe full of sentient robots, cyborgs, psyonics, power armors for dogs and all the galactic turmoil you can imagine, things get worse. A ship from a multiverse spanning empire arrives and wrecks everyone’s shit. A plucky band of resistance fighters takes them on, trying to save their reality.
If you are looking for a sophisticated plot, you have journeyed for naught, my friend. This is all you’ll get.
It’s impossible to write a story that hasn’t been told yet. But this one is simplistic, clumsy at times and as deep as misallocated Einstein quotes.
The story’s tone is self aware and dialogue is upbeat and tongue-in-cheek, but sometimes there’s melancholy, fatalism and some obvious satire/critique between the lines.
I wish the tightrope walk between these would be more balanced. As is, it creates more dissonance than achieving investment in the story.
The writing is solid, with a few hiccups that border on cringe and could’ve been used with more purpose. Humor is a delicate thing and when you don’t have unlimited space to give your characters a voice, the Narrative Designer in me wept when another line dropped that was neither poignant, nor funny and just a repeat of  ‘This universe is SO wacky and absurd!’

There’s scripted ‘events’ where characters will banter a bit, but it's rarely connected to specific characters or their personality and will happen every run without variation. That was deeply disappointing. It would’ve added the experience, if there were at least some special interactions.
I also missed in-combat banter. The enemies have some, but the characters and their bonds didn’t seem to justify the effort.
Their relationship banter is a mixed bag, as some seem to have been written with more love than others, but most of it was heartwarming.
Thus fortunately, a lot of the narrative is carried by the roster of endearing characters, their interactions and some very impressive worldbuilding and corresponding artwork.
The bizarre thing about Star Renegade’s story is, there should be more. And it makes you hungry for more.
There’s so much going on, so many things alluded to... and you get none of it.
I pointed this out with the visuals already. While those do give you more, the story leaves you hungry. It’s the equivalent of someone offering you cake, and when you ask him, if you can buy more of that cake, he says: no, you may only look from 3 meters away, now back the fuck off!
I feel like this was supposed to be a linear story at some point, or rather, I feel it should be, but that’s not what we got.

[b]Gameplay[/b] 

Star Renegades is a turn based game of the Rogue variety. You progressively, over multiple runs, unlock characters and better gear you can then find in each new run.
If you know games like Grandia or Child of Light the core combat will be familiar. Attacks get a place on a  timeline. Who goes before an opponent hits harder, or eats more damage if someone else goes first. There are some attacks that may knock you back on the TL or even kick you straight into the next turn.
This creates an interesting tactical environment, especially if you’re used to XCOM's combat or Darkest Dungeon, where killing as much of your opposition in your turn as possible, or alpha-striking the most dangerous foe is more intuitive.
Combat is all about delays, there are no random factors and it’s  a puzzle to solve similar to Into the Breach, as there’s basically no way to just AoE or crowbar your way through it, unless you have perfect gear. Accordingly, it requires a lot of patience, but every fight you win feels rewarding.
You can get unlucky with certain team compositions or situations. I had encounters where a different tank could’ve cost me the run, because an enemy decided to spam its OP AoE 3 times, or when a sniper cloaks and one-shots your backline, because you have no means of decloaking him.
But mostly, there is a solution or trade you can make to win any encounter.

What sours the whole deal  is that the Roguelite elements are lackluster.
The perks you unlock are insignificant. Same goes for Droid buffs. Mileage may vary, since I got smoothly through my runs. But even then, these perks _optimize_ they do not add anything of substance, like changing playstyle or character capacity, just a numerical bonus that diminishes hard and quickly.
If you have completed the game with base gear, more gear can be uninteresting, though it enables some nice new combos.
Character unlocks are great fun, but a run is short and by the time they reach their most fun potential, the run is basically over.
The gameplay loop is engaging, though I wish as a Roguelite, it would offer more satisfying elements and a more extensive experience.

[b]In Conclusion[/b]

I’ve deeply enjoyed Star Renegades. I also want to scream into the void, because it could have been outstanding, especially narratively. The visuals do so  much of the heavy lifting that I probably would not have considered buying the game if it weren’t for them.

The dialogue was a hearty chuckle the first time around then the 8th-10th time around you are yelling at yourself, ""alright come on I get it this is a grind go away there should be a menu option for this.""

+++++ПЛЮСЫ+++++ 
+ Богатая боевая система, включающая в себя различные типы атак, уязвимостей, сопротивлений и т.д.;
+ Больше десятка персонажей, каждый из которых играется по-своему;
+ Рандомная генерация боссов, благодаря которой схватки с ними более разнообразные, чем в других ролевых играх;
+ Крайне любопытная система временной шкалы (что-то схожее было, если мне не изменяет память, только в OTHERCIDE):
      * Если подконтрольный нам персонаж атакует противника раньше - он гарантированно наносит ему критический урон (что ОЧЕНЬ важно при обдумывании своего хода);
      * Благодаря грамотному использованию умений персонажей можно отсрочить (а то и вовсе прервать) атаку противника (что, РАЗУМЕЕТСЯ, нам на руку);
+ *Маленький спойлер* (хотя о чем я говорю, об этом мы узнаем в первые 15-20 минут игры): вся игра представляет из себя бесконечную временную спираль борьбы ренегатов с империумом. Исходя из этого, если мы проигрываем окончательно - то игра не заканчивается типичным экраном *GAME OVER*, а возвращает нас к самому началу, НО с добытыми ранее ресурсами, что привнесут разнообразие при последующем прохождении.

------МИНУСЫ------
- К сожалению, на данный момент игре не хватает полировки: интерфейс тяжело читаем, особенно поначалу, когда только начинаешь разбираться в игре;
- Отсутствует рандомная генерация карт (что я не назвал бы критичным минусом, ввиду всего вышесказанного);
- Если вам не нравится пиксель-арт - то не думаю, что вам будет приятно в нее играть.

*******ИТОГ*******
Тем не менее я рекомендую данную игру всем любителям JRPG, своих денег она более чем стоит.
Также радует, что данную игру не собираются забрасывать (уже выкатили дорожную карту развития игры), как минимум раз в 2-3 недели выходят патчи, постепенно улучшающие ее.",1604684405,1604684405,True,2,0,0.549499452114105225,0,True,False,False,76561198063349686,236,2,1843,377,913,1613737528,,

The combat is tactical, and fast-paced (for a turn-based game, that is).  
The art is outstanding. 
The lore is interesting and unique. 

CON:

The music is used in a pretty repetitive way.
The plot is paper-thin after the first few hours.

SUBJECTIVE NOTES:

Runs in this rogue-lite can take several hours. My average run is 3-4 hours in length so far, which is pretty long for this genre. I don't see this as a downside, but some people may.

Overall, I think this game is outstanding, and if you enjoy turn-based JRPG style combat with an emphasis on tactical forethought, then this is a game for you. I highly recommend it.

The battle system is great but takes some getting used to. Once you understand the basics and everything clicks, you won't want to stop playing. 

UPDATE: I beat the main campaign. After that you unlock a new one with a new (but similar) goal of defeating the final boss. If you enjoy the combat you'll want to keep playing, but you won't be playing for the story. Which is unfortunate because the opening cut scene really sets the stage for some awesome story and characters, but unfortunately there really isn't that much. Play for the gameplay which is excellent.

I made a video about a basic mechanic of the battle system, the stagger mechanic. I didn't understand this at first which is why I wanted to quit. But once you have a basic understanding of it, it really makes the game so much more fun.

The UI could use some clarifying, but it sounds like improvements are on the roadmap, so I'm hopeful. My only compaint isn't really a complaint, but more of a caution; while this game has user tags like 'JRPG' and 'Tactical RPG', it has almost none of the trappings you'd expect from those. The story and character development are VERY light, mostly just there to frame the core gameplay loop. There aren't any sort of exploration/discovery elements; you're effectively just planning out a route around the same four maps each run and fighting pre-determined battles as you go.

78633464,english,"Hard core turn-based rogue-like strategy gem with beautiful pixel arts, you might thought it was RPG from the screenshot and it is NOT RPG at all. To me the game play is more close to Into The Breach, so as the difficulty.

Pros:
- Great art and atmosphere design. It looks just gorgeous, in <pixel> perfection!
- The right amount of challenging. You'll be constantly taking down the enemy with the last character remaining.
- Friendly battle UI. Result prediction is super helpful, along with allowing to cancel planned moves.
- Fantastic gear/chracter variety and depth. Make every run unique. 


Cons:
- Confusing battle UI. Even though I cleared the game I'm still unclear on what each move does from the enemies after inspection.
- Lagging visual performance. Both the battle and the quest map requires some optimization, it feels like on 20 FPS or lower from time to time.
- Overwhelming new player UX. 
- Lack of identity on character skills. TBO, all the skills are basically casting speed/casting delay/damage type/target mode. I've only been using 2~3 skills out of 8 from each character -- it could be way batter if we have only like 3 distinctive skills for each character, with maybe 2 swap-able sets.

78582658,english,"It's quirky, it's somewhat buggy, it's the best roguelite experience I've had in recent memory. 

If you are a fan of JRPG combat but can't stand the story that comes with it, this might be the game for you. All the strategy and depth of JRPG combat (minus the elemental rock paper scissors) with none of the story baggage.

The setup is that invaders from another dimension are attacking yours, and you must assemble a ragtag band of misfits to repell them. Your ragtag band of misfits gets to know each other better through cute interactions during the downtime, and as a result you get to unlock more misfits to make a ragtag band out of next time you try. And yes. There is innuendo. Overall, what little interaction there is is harmless and funny enough to make the game better, not worse. 

The combat's genuinely tactically engaging, it forces you to make decisions about what you allow to happen and what you don't, what's worth taking the once per combat move out on, and what you save it for. Sometimes there's an optimal solution, but sometimes you just gotta make do. Depending on your choice of strategy and equipment, health is more or less valuable, and your tactics will change as a result. At the end of the day, however, it doesn't make the mistake most roguelites do, in that taking a hit early will make you suffer for the rest of the run. Not here. Wether you scrape by the Behemoth or completely curbstomp it, the end result is the same. 

The strategic decisions have goods and bads. It's definitely possible to make builds happen, 

That being said, the game isn't perfect. I feel like the Nemesis-like system isn't used well in this game. Part of what made Nemesis work in SoM is personality, and you just don't get to experience the personality in these captains because the ones that completely curbstomp you die in the first encounter (asside from one annoying one so far who always runs away at 50% health and takes like 5 turns of concentrated fire to bring even to that point so good luck killing him...). Also the weaknesses are... Some work, like the ones that are affected by attack type, but some are just luck of the draw. The afforementioned cowardly tank is weak to Phasma damage. AKA the rarest attack type in the game. He's a Planet 1 captain. You have /no/ garauntee of killing them. Also the personalities get old fast, and they don't really respond to what you do as a player.

Also, there are bugs, balance issues, and inconsistencies. At launch the Archon was a liability, useless in offense cause he wasted your stagger. This has fortunately been resolved now, but there are definitely still some options that are worse than others. At time of writing, defending some attacks will have them go past your shield without depleting them, however, and I do occasionally still lose a run. Expect the game to change and evolve as the devs work on it, but you will have to endure the inconsistencies, and some strategies you learn will stop working cause of balance changes. 

In summary: If you like JRPG combat, this is the game for you. The combat's worth putting up with the growing pains, and the little story there is doesn't get in the way and is genuinely endearing. There is some waste of potential, mostly the nemesis system, which really doesn't add anything to the game, but I do fully recommend playing this game.

in english below

Сия игра радует глаз любого любителя красивых картинок и в меру ядовитых красок. Неплохой заставкой, красивой мелодией в главном меню и собственно все.
Остальное совсем не радует, игровой процесс очень сложно назвать RPG: 
потому-что экипировка редка и после смерти сбрасывается
потому-что сюжет выполнен в духе игр c Dendy\Sega есть зло идем и боремся, отыгрыша роли как таковой в игре нет, диалоги не вариативны (активируются при повышении привязанности между сопаартийцами, либо при посещении точек интереса)
потому-что сама боевая система с количеством переигровок начинает напрягать, а автобоя нет(хотя именно в такой игре должен быть)
потому-что музыка в игре весьма однообразна

В игру понатаскали разных вещей - босс победивший ваш отряд получает повышение,пряник и вид на жительство в столице(прям как в Middle-earth: Shadow of War), вы же оказавшись у разбитого корыта можете приобрести мелочевку на базе, собрать отряд заново и снова идти в бой. В бою находим редкие бонусы, после боя залечиваем раны открываем одни и те же пассивный и активные бонусы у костра и снова в бой пока планета не будет зачищена. Но главным препятствием станут планетарные боссы их всего 3 и разработчики постарались чтобы каждый следующий был в 3 жирней и вредней первого итого: даже если доползаем до 3го там нас и хоронят и снова привет база и все сначала. 

Ощущение как будто бы разработчик хотел показать как он скомбинировал особенности разных игр, но не оптимизировал нагруженность игрока при перепрохождении, например игра Fury Unleashed при уничтожении 3х боссов главы позволяет в будующем начинать сразу дальше минуя главу.
Как результат мое мнение - к покупке не рекомендую до устранения недостатков.

We meet the successor of games like Middle-earth: Shadow of War and Rogue Legacy, not RPG Star Renegades.

This game pleases the eye of any lover of beautiful pictures and moderately poisonous colors. A good screen saver, a beautiful melody in the main menu, and that's all.
The rest is not at all happy, the gameplay is very difficult to call RPG:
because equipment is rare and is discarded after death
because the plot is made in the spirit of games with Dendy \ Sega there is evil we go and fight, there is no roleplaying as such in the game, the dialogues are not variable (they are activated when affection between party members increases, or when visiting points of interest)
because the combat system itself with the number of replays starts to strain, but there is no auto-fight (although it should be in such a game)
because the music in the game is very monotonous

Various things have been dragged into the game - the boss who defeats your squad gets a promotion, a carrot and a residence permit in the capital (just like in Middle-earth: Shadow of War), but when you find yourself at a broken trough, you can buy small things at the base, collect the squad again and again go into battle. In battle, we find rare bonuses, after the battle we heal wounds, open the same passive and active bonuses by the fire and again into battle until the planet is cleaned. But the main obstacle will be the planetary bosses, there are only 3 of them, and the developers tried to make each next one fatter and more harmful than the first total: even if we crawl to the 3rd there they kill us and again hello base and all over again.

The feeling is as if the developer wanted to show how he combined the features of different games, but did not optimize the load on the player when replaying, for example, the game Fury Unleashed when destroying 3 chapter bosses allows in the future to start immediately further bypassing the chapter.
As a result, my opinion is that I do not recommend buying it until the shortcomings are eliminated.",1604246121,1604248187,False,6,0,0.497864902019500732,0,True,False,False,76561198032503117,115,60,568,0,425,1604316828,,

I've nearly completed the game as far as I can tell, and it's awesome. The gameplay is great. It's almost like an interesting puzzle with each character having unique tools in how they fit into that system. My first two to three wins were very interesting as I explored all the characters, and unlocked some of the deeper content. That was about 15ish hours into the game. Than I realised that the dialogue was repeating. It didn't kill my enjoyment of the game, but it took a bit of the shine off it.

78464376,english,"Its a great blend of the formula everyone has enjoyed since the days of Demon Souls on PS3. You start as weak and really learning how the game mechanics work, you kill some easy trash enemies and a boss as some point utterly destroys you. Rinse and repeat until YOU get better as a player and as your character, or in this case your team, gets better. I LOVE this about this game. A lost battle isn't a loss its a win in a sense as you gain experience as the player, your team gets stronger, your enemies do to a degree as well. 

To give an example without spoiling as much as possible, I got killed by the same Behemoth(type of boss) twice in a row before I finally defeated him. First fight was a joke and I got wrecked before doing much damage. Second one I used a different team and it was better but I still wasn't able to win. Third time, I was more prepared. I became more efficient at planning my attacks to maximize interrupting enemy attacks when possible and minimizing incoming damage. I even figured out how to taunt and redirect attacks away from more squishy teammates. I defeated him with no losses and nobody lost more than maybe 10-15% health. Most damage was shield damage taken.  

Its a beautiful blend of Octopath Traveler visuals, an interesting take on the nemesis system from LoTR: Shadow of War, the fight, die, learn, repeat mechanics of any Souls game. Plus it adds the strategic nature of chess of all things with the way the fights are structured with each action taking a certain amount of time and everyone going in order. Sounds weird but when you play and find you could have interrupted an enemy attack that killed someone because you went in the wrong order, you'll understand.

Story is at times hilarious and at times does get really touching. Characters all have interesting backstory. The writing reminds me of Halcyon writing with some of the one liners. All in all, its a GREAT game that blends a lot of aspects of other great games into a very beautiful and challenging package.

I've already done multiple runs and I haven't got bored of the gameplay yet. The challenge is great, maybe another harder difficulty might be a good option (30% increased hp/dmg and additional boss mechanics) for even more replayability. 

Every hero has the potential to be very powerful, even Empath :D. The different abilities and stats you get through the various progenies allow for a lot of different builds with just one hero-type. 

Your team's effectiveness depends a lot upon your hero combination, as well as your itemization, and making the right decisions on the map counts a lot too. The recent update is great as it grants you a lot more options while levelling up and also lets you develop companionships among different hero combinations really fast. Get at least 1 item which grants lifesteal/health on attack and you should be able to manage any difficulty with relative ease. 

This game is amazing value for money and I'm sure it will continue to improve over time as the updates are regular and focus on issues that matter (Inspire + Killshot yeay! :D).

Les graphismes sont assez jolis et les animations en combat sont plaisantes.

The turn-based combat is rewarding and deep, the visuals are some of the most lush pixel art featured in a game so far, and there's a bevy of unlockables in the form of weapons, characters, classes, and alternate skillsets for your characters in the form of ""progeny"" to unlock to further complicate and customize your subsequent runs through the game (with  the promise of more to come in future updates.)  Hard recommend.  

A word to the diehard jRPG fan:  there is not much of a story here to speak of and what does exist only serves to provide a skeleton to the core gameplay loop.

78066909,english,"A title that has enjoyable gameplay that’s hooked my attention for sustained periods of time, which is a rarity for my taste. That being said, like most games, whether someone “likes” or “dislikes” it, mainly revolves around what you as a player enjoy...

Star Renegades uses a roguelite formula with JRPG-type combat. For well-known games you can use as conceptual references, I would include things such as Darkest Dungeon and Battlechasers, but mixed with common rogue elements as seen in Into the Breach, Chrono Ark, and Dead Cells. Each run takes approximately 6-8 hours (depending on how quickly you play, and how familiar you become with the game) to beat the final boss. You’ll venture through an intro section, 3 planets, and the enemy’s main ship for essentially 3 main zones with a finale on the ship which is much more abbreviated compared to the planets.  Between each zone, you’ll have the opportunity to buy equipment at vendors using a temporary credits currency and recruit one more hero for your crew...

Excluding the small intro section of every run which is pretty straightforward, you’ll have a total of 3 days to explore each planet till the enemy boss shows up there. Your limitation each day boils down to 3 charges of “breaking the enemy’s forcefields” to get to each part of the map. Every section has “something of value” there, whether it’s equipment, credits, shield/armor upgrades, healing crate, etc, oftentimes with an enemy encounter present. Even if there is just an enemy encounter on a spot, that still has value, as you obtain DNA (basically experience points) which you can use to level up your heroes as you desire (in a similar fashion to Chrono Ark)... 

Battle System is really where the game shines in my opinion. I’m quite partial to the typical turn-based JRPG combat formula in general, however, Star Renegades puts some compelling twists on that. First, most abilities are free to use every turn. This means you don’t have to muck about with managing something like mana or energy. Second, there are some abilities that use a Fury resource, which you build up during combat and persist between combats on a planet...

77783140,english,"This game seems wonderfully made with a lot of effort and the style is definitely on point. The main problem I have with the game is that the main gameplay loop is simply not fun. Content is recycled frequently (which is to be expected from a roguelike) but it feels like they're constantly trapping themselves into having to recycle more content because the game has a secondary feature of rpg-like mechanics and dialogues between the characters. After about 4-5 runs (not necessarily beating the game just getting to the final area mostly) you've already seen most of the content in the game. There are three more classes I haven't unlocked but at this point I don't necessarily care because I've beat the final boss (which is total bullshit if you don't have the perfectly correct team comp to fight them, my first go against them was a long grueling tragic fight that took forever and ended with me feeling like I had almost won but just didn't have the tools to properly do so, my second go around I had built a team comp around beating the final boss and it was literally a cakewalk that took a few minutes max). So that brings me to my final problem, the difficulty curve is broken and not in a good way. I've tried various team comps to try and keep the game fun for myself but it mostly boils down to ""have the right team comp and you win or have the wrong comp and you will struggle to get past the first planet"". Also the game hides what level ups on your characters do for you until you have enough DNA (EXP) to level them up, this seems really weird to me because you can see all of the abilities and unlocks you get for leveling them up when you are in the pre-game screen. But, if you don't have all of this memorized it feels like they're unfairly hiding information from you. I suppose you could just look it up on a wiki but I personally don't find the game fun enough to put in that kind of effort for it anymore. I gave the game over 20 hours to get better because I could just get lost in the gameplay loop but it loses it's charm after a few runs and you've seen literally all the content the game has to offer. Aside from that there are just some minor issues like how the auto-pathing for navigating the worlds is kind of terrible, also you can get bonuses for WALKING ACROSS THE ENTIRE PLANET BACK TO THE STARTING AREA??? I don't understand why they would put in such a feature but I guess it helps sum up my overall issues with the game: It feels slightly burnt. I bought this game in early access and I was very surprised by their 1.0 release, I guess I bought it late into development but it felt like literally nothing changed from the day I bought it until today where I got bored halfway through my latest run and decided to come spill my thoughts here. I don't think it's a bad game and the developers clearly loved their project, I just wish they had more time to work on it and kept it in early access longer to improve upon what they already had. I don't see a reason to recycle so, many, dialogues in an entirely text based game. There is no voice acting so it does feel somewhat lazy when I've played the game for 20 hours and I'm seeing multiple characters spew out the same lines about the same titan hands, when you go to fight the first boss someone says ""I know this is a bad time to ask,,, but what is a titan core? Ah nevermind"" (quote may be off a bit). It was funny the first time, it was off putting the second, and the ~10th time I let out an audible sigh. 

My last problem with the game is the tone but I think that's more of a personal issue, when you lose a run you are immediately taken to the bar (interesting choice?) and then the bartender will say some quirkly line like ""our new overlords have just opened an organ harvesting plant"" or something like that and you can go around and talk to some characters you have unlocked and they're just chatting each other up like they're around a campfire chilling (which is another mechanic in this game). This also only happened once so I'm not sure if it was a bug but I had a dead party member appear in the bar and was just sitting there with her drink talking to an unlocked party member that wasn't used. 

I'm rambling but I wish they had just put more playtesting into the game and kept it in early access long enough to just smooth out the edges and add in more dialogues. There's a rich environment here to build upon and I feel a lot of the opportunity they created with their world building just doesn't land or maybe they want more investment into the game to find it. Over 20 hours is kind of enough for me, I have a short attention span and if a game wants more investment than that to get to the good parts of the narrative (that I don't think it has because the opening cinematic of the game has literally nothing to do with the game itself and leaves me so confused everytime I see it) that I just don't recommend this game unless you're a hardcore fan of roguelikes and love reliable repeatable dialogues and having the same abilities on the same party members run after run. Also there is a gear mechanic and it is completely RNG and can make or break a run, bosses / Elites can often have resistances to different elemental types and gear is very very limited. So if you only have one rifle for your main DPS and it's pyro damage and the next boss is a firewulf (who is resistant to Pyro) your option is to not use your weapon or to deal 50% less damage to them the entire fight. This game just has so many frustrating mechanics.

TL;DR: 
Game mechanics are meh
Gear mechanics feel burnt
RPG and Dialogue mechanics feel broken and awkward (different characters repeating lines you've seen several times in previous runs... but it's all text based so there's no real reason to not have ATLEAST lines for each character to give them more individual flavour)
Camping mechanics are meh

77667765,english,"I wanted to like it, but I can't.
The graphics are the terrible type of pixel art that doesn't resemble anything or have any consistency with one character looking vaguely like a C64 sprite and the one next to it 16-bit. All it makes me think is that I'm running the game on low settings in 1998.
""Why would you buy a game with pixel art if you don't like it?"" my co-worker asked me. I was leaving for a business trip, long story short, I wanted a lightweight game for my work laptop to keep me entertained. I made the mistake of not reading the required specs... FTL, Into the Breach, Tangledeep, all pixel art games that run fine on my little work toaster with on board graphics. Star Renegades was chugging along at 15 FPS. No options to turn down the settings so whatever it was wasn't turning my laptop and lap into immolated flesh. Just an option to cap it at 30 FPS. Not even the opening cutscene could hit that. Holy hell, make it a video and play it if you have to.
Gameplay/Story: Scratch story, I don't care. If I wanted a story on my trip, I'd get a book. But Star Renegades... can you believe there's a button to fast forward the combat, like, all the gameplay, can be fast forwarded (why would I?) Then the text has me mashing LMB like the Fist of the North Star because it's super important that I don't skip the mindless banter between two party members, but yeah, no, they have a button to fast forward combat, but not skip story. Kinda bass ackwards if you ask me.
There's an area that shows the leadership in any given area, more unskippable banter. And the progression of enemy strengths and weaknesses is... strange? First area might have a leader resistant to nitro. Considering my inventory is empty and I maybe have 1 gun to pass around the squad, better hope it's not nitro! Late game, it hardly seemed to matter as a high level item that does +80% damage out paces the +50% resistance they might have to it, but such is the roguelike life. 
Then come to find out the latest patch fixed resistances and weaknesses were fixed to actually work. Wew. Again, seems like not enough attention was paid to the gameplay of this game.
The combat UI is a mess and painful to navigate. But once done, some brutal bubblegum chewing can happen. Oh wait, we can fast forward that, no one wants to see it anyway, right?
Areas, there's like 2 versions of each world, then maybe a couple side areas, the final area... 10 maps total? In a roguelike that's meant to be played over, and over again? C'mon...
I had so much hope, so much was set up to be an enjoyable experience...
But the devs left the gameplay in their other pants as they rushed out the new age retro pixel graphics and story of bare bones.
I put nearly 84 hours into playing this, (albeit, at 15 FPS, so maybe only 40 hours of gameplay.) I wanted to like it. But I can't.

77655481,english,"It is important that you read the whole review for this one, because the ""Yes"" is put here for a reason.


Lets break this down to my usual review method. Good, bad and ugly.
Overview: The creators of Halcyon 6 proudly return after the success of the tactical RPG to bring us the greatest collection of 1990's video game tropes mixed with 2010's movie tropes along with it. Demonstrating their unique and talented skill with the pixel, they have created a beautiful series of (pink) worlds mixed up with beautiful (and pink) 2.5 D combat scenes. You have access to a scrappy team of adventurers each with unique skills and weapons that allows you to destroy your foes. You pick paths through pre-made maps on three different worlds looking for (pink) DNA which serves as experience, cash and items. 

The goal? Get to the enemy flagship and defeat the boss. Once you defeat the boss, you get to do it all over again!

Unlock new characters through a 'dating' system, those new characters having unique abilities and playstyles. Every time you lose, you get to spend 'intel' to unlock new items and modifications to the world to make your adventures more and more interesting. 

The Good: First, the pixel art is fantastic. Kudos, though everything is SATURATED with pink. Even on not pink worlds, the pink is omnipresent. The different characters are all amusing to play with and are unique enough to actually make you think before selecting (though some seem to be the must-haves in the game).  The gameplay system is fun to play and reasonably unique, though it is somewhat similar to Chrono Cross with it's time tracking system. The dating system to unlock characters and palette swaps makes the completionist pick all sorts of characters to find new ways to win.  Victory is not guaranteed, and losing is part of the game mechanics for developing your characters.  There were strong nostalgia moments of Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, and even Valkyrie Profile in the gameplay. Difficulty is on the high end, though you can play on easy mode if you must.  

The Bad: NOTHING IN THIS GAME IS ORIGINAL CONTENT. So much of this game is ripped off from other IP's its actually a bit embarrassing. While it may barely dodge legal trouble it is really sad to see that they couldn't come up with their own ideas. The game has this odd mix of Pixel art and flash animation-like moments which just don't mix very well. Leveling up wastes time with useless splash screens and ugly numerical animations which look like things taken from the shockwave era of browser animation.  The 'dating' system is a bad joke and the writing is TERRIBLE. The dialogue reads like trash that an 8 year old would write. The difficulty can sometimes spike like crazy, causing a fully set up team to go down like a wet sandwich in two rounds.  Some game mechanics simply don't make any sense (like enemy armor suddenly becoming invincible even against armor sundering attacks), and are difficult to identify. Items are found sometimes at such high levels that you never get to actually use them...and you can't sell them either.

There are a lot of bugs. 

PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINK

The Ugly: Despite what would normally be a totally disqualifying series of bad decisions by the developers, this game is saved by it's game play. There is potential here and it's pretty clear that the devs are releasing more content and will be renovating other aspects of the game. 


This means of course that the game was released in an unfinished state, and should be considered a Crypto-Early Access game until some time in February. This game just wasn't ready for prime time.

77528572,thai,"[h1]อีกหนึ่งเกมวางแผนสไตล์ Rougelite ที่มีจุดเด่นซึ่งเกือบจะไม่เหมือนใคร[/h1]

'Star Renegades' คือเกมวางแผนสไตล์ Turn-base/Roguelite ซึ่งอาจจะมีบางองค์ประกอบที่ให้ความรู้สึกเหมือนเกม RPG ปะปนอยู่ ตัวเกมมีจุดเด่นที่การนำเสนอ ระบบต่อสู้ที่ยืดหยุ่นแต่บีบคั้น เพราะการสู้กับศัตรูทุกครั้งจะบีบให้คุณใช้กลยุทธ์และความได้เปรียบของตัวละครแต่ละตัวในทีมของคุณเพื่อจัดการกับเหล่าศัตรู ด้านการนำเสนอเองก็ถูกถ่ายทอดออกมาด้วยงานศิลป์สไตล์ Pixel Art ที่ดูดีมีสไตล์ และเนื่องด้วยตัวเกมที่ชูความเป็น Roguelite แน่นอนว่าเกมจะเน้นให้คุณบุกตะลุยไปข้างหน้าให้ไกลที่สุดเท่าที่คุณจะไปได้และตายซ้ำซากเพื่อกลับมาเริ่มต้นใหม่ กระนั้นระบบของเกมเองก็ไม่ได้นำเสนอการเล่นแบบฉาบฉวยเหมือนเกมอื่นๆที่แค่ท้าทายผู้เล่นว่าจะเล่นไปได้ไกลแค่ไหน เพราะตัวเกมมี Progression ให้คุณได้เก็บเพื่อเปิดเข้าสู่ตัวเลือกใหม่ในการเล่นครั้งต่อไป เช่น ทักษะที่เพิ่มขึ้น ความสามารถของตัวละครแต่ละตัวที่เพิ่มขึ้น การอัพเกรดอาวุธใหม่ และเพราะระบบศัตรูในแต่ละฉากของเกมมีลักษณะที่คล้ายกับระบบ Nemesis ของเกมอย่าง Shadow of War ศัตรูที่เป็นแม่ทัพแต่ละตัวจะมีระดับขั้น หากมันฆ่าคุณได้พวกมันจะเลื่อนขั้นและแข็งแกร่งขึ้น การเจอพวกมันครั้งต่อไปก็จะยากขึ้น ตำแหน่งที่เจอก็อาจจะเปลี่ยนไป ทำให้การเล่นใหม่หลังจากตายกลับมาจุดเกิดทุกครั้งแทบไม่มีครั้งไหนที่ให้ความรู้สึกเหมือนเดิมเป๊ะๆ กันได้เลย

การหยิบจับเรื่องราวของจักรวาลคู่ขนานต่างๆ มาใช้ในการเล่าเรื่องก็ถือว่าค่อนข้างจะสมเหตุสมผลกับระบบของเกมอยู่ แต่เอาจริงๆสำหรับผมแล้วตัวเนื้อเรื่องนั้นไม่ได้ดึงดูดอะไรมากนัก ข้อมูลหลายอย่างที่ร้อยเรียงเป็นเรื่องราวถูกแฝงไว้ในบทสนทนาต่างๆ ของตัวละครที่คุณจะได้พบเจอ ซึ่งแน่นอนถ้าคุณไม่ชอบอ่านคุณก็อาจจะพลาดอะไรไป กระนั้นสิ่งที่โดดเด่นที่สุดก็ไม่ใช่เนื้อเรื่องอยู่ดีแต่เป็นระบบต่อสู้ที่ออกแบบมาได้ค่อนข้างดีมาก ทุกการกระทำ ทุกท่วงท่าที่คุณกดใช้นั้นมีความหมายและอาจส่งผลต่อการสู้รบในครานั้นได้เลย (บาง Skill บางทักษะ เลือกกดใช้ผิดเวลา ชีวิตลำบากได้เลย lol) แต่การวางแผนและปรับเปลี่ยนกลยุทธ์ในการเล่นนั้นก็สามารถทำได้อย่างยืดหยุ่น ตัวละครฮีโร่แต่ละตัวมีจุดเด่นเฉพาะซึ่งเหมาะกับการรับมือศัตรูแต่ละชนิดแตกต่างกันไป (คุณเลือกตัวละครลงเล่นแต่ละรอบเริ่มต้นได้ที่ 3 ตัว จึงต้องเลือกให้ดี) กระนั้นความสามารถของฮีโร่แต่ละตัวก็สามารถทดแทนกันได้ (ในบางมุม) และเกมก็ไม่ได้บังคับว่าถ้าคุณกำลังเจอกับศัตรูตัวนั้นตัวนี้ คุณต้องใช้ฮีโร่เฉพาะทางมาสู้กับมันเท่านั้น การต่อสู้ส่วนใหญ่จึงพลิกแพลงได้ตามกลยุทธ์และลำดับวิธีโจมตีที่คุณต้องการใช้เล่น เกมเพลย์เองอาจชวนให้คุณนึกถึงเกมสไตล์ Dungeon Crawler ที่คุณต้องพยายามบุกตะลุยไปให้ไกลที่สุด เพื่อเก็บทักษะ ปลดอาวุธ ค้นหาเพื่อนร่วมทาง และสะสมแต้มคะแนนพิเศษต่างๆ เพื่อนำมาใช้ปลดล็อกในการเล่นในครั้งถัดไป ส่วนเรื่องความยากต้องบอกเลยว่าค่อนข้างตึงมือและต้องคิดเยอะ (ถ้าซีเรียสว่าจะไปให้ไกลหรือไปให้สุดเกม) หลายคนเทียบกับเกมอย่าง Darkest Dungeon แต่ผมว่ามันไม่ได้โหดร้ายขนาดนั้น อย่างไรก็ดีการตายซ้่ำๆหรือพ่ายแพ้รัวๆ จะทำให้การเล่นในรอบต่อไปนั้นง่ายขึ้นและเกมก็จะสนุกมากยิ่งขึ้นในรอบหลังๆที่คุณเล่นมันด้วย (ถ้าคุณไม่เบื่อมันซะก่อนน่ะนะ)

เสียงประกอบดี กราฟิกดูดีไม่ขี้เหร่แม้จะเป็น Pixel Art ปัญหาเรื่อง Performance เท่าที่เล่นมาก็ไม่เจออะไร บัคต่างๆ เท่าที่เล่นมาก็ไม่เจอ แต่มีสิ่งหนึ่งที่กวนใจผมมากตลอดการเล่นก็คือ เรื่องของ UI โดยเฉพาะตอนที่ต้องเลือกท่าโจมตีใส่ศัตรูเพื่อทำการป้องกันหรือรอสวนกลับซึ่งเกมจะมีลูกศรแสดงให้เห็นเป็นสีแดงว่า ศัตรูตัวไหนจะโจมตีตัวละครของเราตัวไหน เจ้าเส้นสีที่บอกลำดับการโจมตีจากศัตรูนี่แหละที่บางครั้งมันไม่ชัดเจนนักเพราะบางครั้งศัตรูมีการยืนซ้อนตำแหน่งกัน ทำให้มันค่อนข้างจะมองยากว่าเส้นสีมันระบุที่ศัตรูตัวไหน ซึ่งจุดนี้ค่อนข้างส่งผลต่อการวางแผนการเล่น เพราะบางทีเราต้องการสั่งฮีโร่เราใช้ท่าพิเศษเพื่อสกัดใม่ให้ศัตรูโจมตี แต่พอกดใช้ไปดันเล็งไปที่ศัตรูผิดตัวเพราะปัญหาที่กล่าวมา แล้วการสั่งโจมตีไปแล้วในแต่ละรอบมันยกเลิกไม่ได้ทำให้บางทีสั่งผิดชีวิตเปลี่ยน ได้กลับไปเล่นกันใหม่หมดตั้งแต่แรกเพราะตายหมู่ก็มีเหมือนกัน

สรุปโดยรวมแล้ว 'Star Renegades' เป็นเกมวางแผนลุยด่านที่เล่นได้สนุกและมีการออกแบบระบบหลายๆ อย่างมาค่อนข้างดีเลย ถ้าคุณชอบความเป็น Rouguelite ไม่เบื่อที่จะต้องพยายามเล่นครั้งแล้วครั้งเล่าเพื่อให้เก่งขึ้น ชอบการลุยกับศัตรูไปเรื่อยๆในแผนที่สไตล์ Dungeon Crawler เกมนี้น่าจะโดนใจได้ไม่ยาก เกมเล่นได้ติดพันและสนุกติดมือพอควรส่วนราคาค่าตัวก็ไมได้แพงอะไรเมื่อเทียบกับสิ่งที่คุณจะได้รับ  
--------------------------------------------
++ การผสมรวมการเล่นแบบวางแผน Turn-base/Roguelite ทำได้น่าสนใจ ระบบต่อสู้ที่ยืดหยุ่นแต่ส่งผลต่อการเล่นจริงจัง กราฟิกดูดีมีสไตล์ เพลงและเสียงประกอบทำได้ดี คุณค่าในการเล่นซ้่ำสูง (ถ้าคุณไม่เบื่อ)

+/- ตัวเกมเน้นให้ผู้เล่นเรียนรู้ศัตรูจากการต่อสู้ซึ่งหลายครั้งคุณจะตายและถูกส่งกลับไปเริ่มใหม่ หลายคนอาจไม่ชอบการนำเสนอรูปแบบนี้แม้มันจะเป็นมาตรฐานสำหรับเกมแนว Rougelite ทั่วไปก็ตาม

- ปัญหาเรื่องของ UI ที่สร้างความสับสนในการเล่นบางครั้งบางคราว

77468928,english,"Basically, this game starts off feeling like a kinda mean RPG that will kill you, and eventually evolves into its true form as a rpg-inspired puzzle game.  The basic puzzle is to combine all your characters moves to stagger enemies off the timeline and/or kill them before they do damage beyond your shields and start taking chunks out of your much harder to heal health pools.  There are a large number of different characters, and every single one of them is capable of contributing a meaningful way - the balance is great.  There are different strategies that work - tanking/redirecting, healing, and pure stagger, as long as you have enough damage on top of the rest of the build to actually finish off the enemies before you run out of shields.

there's a little exploration game, where you decide your specific encounters, and a camping minigame to heal/buff/bond, but the vast majority of the time you are fighting very challenging combats.  The reason the game feels so mean when you just start playing is that there aren't trash mobs.  There's no grinding.  Every enemy has the capability of doing some real damage or even defeating your entire team, ending that run.  The common roguelike expectation of endless trash then some randomly generated elite that 1-shots you is not enforced here.  Every fight feels like you have a chance and if you're careful enough, you could win (well, maaybe not the final boss sometimes if it gets the extra round of summons off.  ugh).  Take the fights slowly and carefully, and never dismiss a fight just because it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, and you can get some real fun out of it.

The story is as barebones as they come for roguelikes. The characters each have their own personalities, sure, but they are incredibly one-dimensional and every single line of dialogue is written to be a joke. There's a pseudo-Middle Earth ""nemesis system"" knock off in the game. It doesn't do anything really. Surviving enemies will carry over to the next run, but the end bosses have no variation, and the ""weaknesses"" to each encounter are really just things you would do anyway.

In summary, the game is a charming attempt at a party-based, roguelike, RPG. It has a lot of interesting ideas, but doesn't commit to any of them adequately - nor does it do a good job of stringing them together.

Although, this game has SOOO many downsides. I wish it can be fixed ASAP
I have habit of pirating game first before purchasing it (I like to call it extended demo)
For example I did it with Monster Train. Sadly, probably transferring ur save files make certain achievements in this game locked (I checked the forum and someguy who transferred it from GOG got locked too). 
It still has bugs and gameplay inconvenient left-right. I buy-equip a weapon for my Gunslinger and it doesnt replace her former weapon. In the late game, things might be happening simultaneously (AND IT'S FUN! It's like solving puzzle with no real one true answer!) and get convoluted but the UI is not really optimized that ur buff and debuff is blocked by ur attack list. Some fps drop there and there. Imbalance in gameplay elements. I play this game for like a week and can't stop wishing everything gets hotfixed immediately.
AND
My biggest issue with this game,
the game gives u this tragic - although borderline niche - opening clip. The tutorial even gives u this mood for the game. It allures you to this massive rich sci-fi universe potential. But the dialogues only presents like 10% serious moment. It feels like 95% of the rosters (probably 100% of the playable characters) are upbeat, sidekick-ish character who make jokes 24/7. It gave me giggles at first. Then, I felt it's borderline boring. It's not the joke filled atmosphere that bugs me, it's the wasted unexplored lore that disappoints me the most. 

Despite all of those downsides, this game holds so much potential that I can't let my self not give this game a positive review. I can see the day where those pet peeves are gone and I finger cross every night that it will have mod support.

The music is great and fits the game very well. Being a rougelike though the music will get stuck in your head which can be a good or bad thing.

Gameplay wise it can be a either challenging or a cakewalk depending on the characters you choose(there is a difficulty option after your first win/defeat). Some characters are definitely WAY stronger than others since the combat revolves around a time line system and you can basically negate an enemy or group of enemies from ever attacking with the right team but I wouldn't say there's a weak or OP character. The behemoths (bosses) can be weird in the sense that the 1st behemoth can be the hardest and the 3rd behemoth the easiest because of the team members you unlock on the way(2 + your starting 3)

Also there's this nemesis system which I guess can be annoying if you keep dieing to the same lieutenants and elites, but since you want to kill all of them anyways to gain the most exp per planet this systems doesn't really matter IMO?

I think most will say that the narrative/lore is very 50/50.
You'll either love it or hate it. 
It's very jokey and it has alot of charm which I enjoy, but there's alot of lore we don't really get to experience unfortunately.

77194774,brazilian,"        Star Renegades é um RPG roguelite de estratégia com a seguinte premissa, o Imperium, uma força invasora que conquista e devasta dimensões segue em busca da dominação de todo o tempo e espaço conhecido. J5T, um robô operário viaja pelas dimensões alertando sobre a vinda do Imperium e tenta reunir heróis capazes de enfrentar e deter o Imperium de uma vez por todas.

        E essa premissa justifica muito bem o aspecto roguelike do jogo, onde a cada partida o jogador enfrenta grupos de inimigos, adquire aliados e reúne recursos que vão tornando o seu grupo mais forte.

        O que acontece é que Star Renegades é um jogo repleto de sistemas complexos em sua concepção, mas que funcionam muito bem evoluindo aspectos de Halcyon Six, jogo anterior da desenvolvedora Massive Damage que pode ser descrito como uma mistura de FTL com XCOM. 

	O jogo se passa em um mapa dividido em setores. Ao entrar em um setor devemos lidar com as ações que irão ocorrer ali. Enquanto alguns setores possuem inimigos que irão atacar assim que entrarmos nele, outros possuem apenas itens a serem recolhidos ou lugares a serem explorados. 

	Três planetas separam o Imperium do domínio da realidade. O jogador deve percorrer cada um dos planetas derrotando os generais e chegar aos núcleos antes que os behemoths, inimigos massivos cheguem ao planeta.

	Cada setor deve ser destrancado pelo robô operário, porém J5T pode utilizar apenas 3 cargas de desbloqueio por dia, após 3 dias os Behemoths chegam ao planeta e devem ser enfrentados pelo jogador. 

	Após o uso das cargas anoitece e o jogador pode explorar setores já abertos e depois deve acampar até o dia seguinte. Durante esse acampamento é possível utilizar algumas cartas que além de conferir status diferentes aos personagens também podem recuperar vida ou armadura. 

	Utilizando essas cartas, laços vão sendo criados entre os personagens, o que aumenta a sinergia entre eles. Quanto maior essa sinergia, o relacionamento dos personagens evolui, levando não só ao desbloqueio de novos status mas também novas habilidades poderosas que podem ser usadas em conjunto. 

         A cola de todos esses sistemas é um combate refinado e repleto de pormenores que adicionam uma complexidade muito bem vinda a mecânica de combate por turnos.

	No início contamos com um grupo de 3 personagens que vai crescendo cada vez que o jogador completa um planeta. Mas ao passar para o próximo, o seu grupo cresce com a possibilidade de contratar um novo personagem e as mecânicas vão se tornando mais profundas. 

        Existem diversos aspectos aos quais o jogador deve estar ligado durante o combate. Cada personagem ou inimigo possui uma HUD com duas barras. A vida é representada pela barra vermelha enquanto a azul representa o escudo. Alguns golpes podem atingir a vida diretamente, mas a grande maioria dos golpes precisa exaurir os escudos antes de causar dano a vida. 

         Os golpes possuem categorias que representam o tipo de dano que eles irão causar, como Light, Heavy, AOE, Flurry, e etc, não vou explicar aqui o que cada um deles quer dizer, mas isso faz parte das camadas do combate, já que inimigos e aliados podem possuir resistências ou fraquezas a determinados tipos de dano. 
Cada golpe leva um tempo para ser executado, o que altera a ordem dos lutadores na timeline. Golpes mais rápidos permitem que seu personagem ataque antes enquanto ataques mais pesados necessitam de mais tempo e portanto levam o seu personagem mais adiante na timeline. O que ocorre, é que ao atacar antes de um ataque inimigo pode ocasionar um ataque crítico, o que causa alguns efeitos adicionais.

        Esses efeitos podem aumentar o dano, deixar o adversário tonto, causar dano a armadura ou movimentar o adversário através da timeline. Caso o adversário atingido seja arremessado além da timeline ele perde a vez e só pode jogar no próximo turno. Mas para impedir a exploração desregrada desse recurso, existe um limite de vezes que um inimigo pode ser empurrado, depois desse limite ele só pode ser empurrado depois que algo reiniciar esse status. O que? Você me pergunta. 

        Então, esse é um dos pontos que o jogo poderia ser mais claro, é o tipo de coisa que entendo como funciona, ou seja, não atrapalha o meu jogo, mas se eu disser que sei o que causa esse reboot no status eu vou estar mentindo. 

        Mas apesar dessa falta de clareza em alguns momentos, todo o sistema de combate é muito bem amarrado. Enquanto em alguns RPGs táticos você pode escolher a primeira opção de ataque infinitamente e chegar até o final do jogo, o combate de Star Renegades possui uma complexidade que eu realmente aprecio.

         O jogador deve pensar muito bem no dano que seus golpes irão causar, os danos que o seu personagem irá tomar, em que local da timeline aquela ação vai colocá-lo e principalmente se aquela ação irá abrir espaço para que outras ações sejam executadas mais à frente. 

          A própria administração do dano deve ser levada a sério, já que escudos se regeneram mas a vida dos personagens deve ser ativamente recuperada, fazendo com que o jogador seja obrigado a administrar seus recursos e pensar muito bem no caminho que irá seguir pela fase. 

          Para um roguelike as partidas são bem longas, a minha partida final durou cerca de 4 horas, mas o jogo é muito permissivo com a possibilidade de salvar, o que permite que você pare o jogo a qualquer momento para continuar em uma próxima oportunidade.

          O visual de Star Renegades é muito maneiro. Não só sua Pixel Art é lindíssima, mas o conceito dos personagens é algo que deveria setar tendências. Todos os personagens são diferentes entre si, muito bem trabalhados e com personalidade.

           Eles não caem na estética batida que se esperaria baseada na temática, mas não só eles são diferentes esteticamente como também possuem habilidades completamente diferentes uns dos outros, se encaixando de forma surpreendente em arquétipos conhecidos, mas subvertendo expectativas, fazendo com que a escolha do seu time influencie diretamente a dificuldade das partidas. 

           O jogo foi com certeza uma grata surpresa e um dos meus preferidos do ano.

I've played hundreds of hours of FTL and Into the Breach, which are hybrid roguelites like this one, but I doubt I'll play this one again.

Switching my rating to ""not recommended"" - it's not worthwhile to pay $30 for a game and only get five hours of play-time out of it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW
-----

Star Renegades is a turn-based RPG in a loose JRPG style with tactical elements.

Graphics - Decent (4/5).  The art style is pretty nice and fits the game very well.  Some of the enemy mecha are extremely well-designed.  Planet screens are not super impressive.  Most NPCs could have been brought over from an Atari 5200 without any modifications.

Sound - Okay (3/5).  The sound effects are competent.  The music is decent, but repetitive.  There have been much better chip-tune soundtracks than this in recent years.  Dicey Dungeons definitely blew this game out of the water when it comes to Indie tracks... but then, they did hire Chipzel.  Kind of cheating.

Gameplay - Good (4/5).  This is honestly one of the most engaging turn-based RPGs I've ever played.  The characters work together like MOBA characters, in well-defined roles.  It is obvious that a hell of a lot of playtest and polish went into this.  If you like turn-based combat, you'll probably love this.  If you don't, this isn't the game for you.  The turn-based RPG system is basically the entire game, minus a bit of overland map stuff that is very short and usually not important to the (sort of) plot.

Plot - Poor (1/5) - It's an excuse plot, and they are using the exact same ""dimension hopper"" bit as Into The Breach, except it's not nearly as interesting, compelling, or mysterious.  I mean... it's a rogue-lite.  You're not here for the plot, are you?

Characters (Combat Design) - Amazing (5/5) - The best part of the game by far.  The design of each character is almost exquisite, and the combinations result in some really, really nice synergy.

Characters (Backstory and Dialog) - Insipid (2/5) - Imagine the more boring moments of dialogue from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, repeat ad nauseum, and you've got what this game has.  TBH, the writing here leaves a lot to be desired.

Setting - Mostly Generic (2/5) - It's a whole crap-ton of sci-fi tropes squished together in a mostly tasty sandwich best eaten while hungover.  Again, it's a rogue-lite.  The fact that they actually MADE a setting is a luxury.

Other Comments
-They could really cut some of the delays in status pop-ups.  They slow the combat down a lot.
-The ""Fast forward"" function would be much nicer if it didn't try to look like a VHS tape fast-forwarding.  An option to FF without the visual feature would be nice.
-The backstory of the Eternalists is... um... not good.  It's very similar to the stories that medieval christians (and some modern ones unfortunately) told about the Jews - the Blood Libel.  There are certain ways to pull off an NPC race being parasitically immortal, but this is really not a tasteful way to do it.  This is actually an example of where a sensitivity reader may have been a good idea.
-One of the best dialogue interactions I've seen is between the Valkyrie and the Aegis.  When's the last time you saw two dedicated female fighters doing nothing but talking shop about weapons and armor?  This might actually be a first.  Progress.

Overall Score (3/5) - It's a good game, but not a great one.  I've enjoyed the turn-based combat quite a bit.  If you like turn-based, buy this.  You won't regret it.

SOME SPOILERS AHEAD

The graphics are great

The music is ordinary and very repetitive, after a few runs I just turned it off completely

The fighting system is interesting but once you understand how it works (just do the tutorial and you should be good) it gets very very easy. Delay enemies enough to make them lose their turn, hit the remaining ones first to they don't do any heavy damage. 

You have an enemy system like in Shadow of Mordor where some enemies, if they kill you or survive a run, get bonuses. Honestly I really don't care about such a system is a game that is so limited. Ok yes that boss gets damage resistance vs heavy hits, but the heavy hit, even with the lowered damage, still does much more damage than the other attacks, once the boss is broken it doesn't change anything.

Character progression is ok, but you never make any skill or card choice, so you can't attempt to build a character, you can somewhat do it with gear but not really at the same time.

You can have alternative attributes for each character, their colour changes with the variation you choose to go with, but each character have a great option, an option where you get bonus to relationship and a less than great option. Guess what option you will select once you have unlocked all the characters?

The character friendship is nice, you get bonuses, special combo skills and sometimes babies if you have the right 2 characters.

The story is where I have my biggest problem, the way the game starts it makes you think the brother and sister are important, but they are not. First run Davion is the ""bad"" guy, second run Wynn in the ""bad guy"", third run Nodo is the ""bad guy"", I can only guess who the ""bad guys"" for the next 10 runs would be. Someone on the forum mentioned that after 13 victories you never get to fight Mother, they are probably saving her for an expansion or something like that.",1601857437,1601857437,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,76561198024981270,289,21,1841,0,1841,1601849244,,

However, I decided to give this game a try anyway since it looked really interesting and had rogue-lite elements.  I am so glad i did. 

The combat in this game is so much fun, and the stagger/crit system adds a whole new layer of complexity to the game that i didn't expect. There's obviously a lot of thought that went into this combat system, with many different damage and armor types, element types, and enemy resistances, weaknesses, and modifiers for pretty much anything. On top of that, the animations, and camera angles, and the art just look amazing. All of this just made the game really enjoyable for me.

Progression in this game feels very much like a rogue-lite with many RPG elements, so expect something that's a little lean on the story, with some funny dialogue and lore, but focuses more on replay-value with challenging combat (at higher difficulty settings), lots of boss fights, randomly generated maps, fun and impactful gear upgrades, and meta-progression between runs.

This game also has quite a lot of variety. Between runs your able to unlock more gear, characters, passives, skins, and all kinds of stuff. There are many characters to choose from. for each character you can unlock different skins with different passives, and also different movesets and stats that slightly change the way to play that character. This makes every run feel fresh, and adds variety even when playing the same characters.

76827814,english,"The game starts with a gorgeous intro, and I wish there was more of that level of quality on the game's other cutscenes.
It felt peculiar at first, so see those blocky 2D jagged edged and pixelated chars, on higher resolution smooth scrolling 3D backgrounds - not to say the pixelated graphics aren't lovely and well animated on their own. What I mean it that the game merges two levels/scales of graphics together, and from a mainly aesthetic point of view, it sometimes clashes (to me, at least).

Well, that said, there's a lot of love in this game, and it shows on several details. Not only are the graphics good, but the music is also catchy, the storyline is not the most elaborate plot but it's quite smart. Even the dialogues are humorous and witty and show that a lot of time was put into this. At the time the game still has a few bugs, but the team is activelly working on fixing them so it will only be getting better.

As for gameplay, Star Renegades is a Strategy meets RPG game - with a few layers I'll try to explain - where the player fights several battles, on different planets, against different enemies, with a team that also changes on every run (enter the rogue-lite factor).

Enemies get some specific traits randomly, so you will not always be able to kill the ""same"" enemy with the same strategy.
The battles have a time/action bar on top, and this is integrated with a stagger system: some attacks have the ability to delay the enemies' actions on that time bar, so if you push them off the bar, you reach a ""Break"" point, successfully preventing one or more enemies from attacking on that turn and/or disabling some enemies' abilities.

To add another layer, all chars and enemies have a potential for Shields, Armor, and HP.
Attacks can also have different effects (like bleed, burn, slow, etc), and some of those will only be effective after you get past the Shields, for example.

You start your first run with the same 3 chars, and notice some clear differences between them - some chars are tankier, others are more support oriented, others have the some abilities to cause bigger stagger effects... After the fights you get DNA points that you will use to level up your team's specs. Those specs are also subject to changes from items you find: some improve defense, increase shields, some weapons raise damage on a specific kind of attack (or on all attacks), etc.

Then there's also your team's chars relationships, that you are able to develop and improve during camping, every night after a series of battles. As the relationships grow the chars get new abilities and/or increased specs.

Complex enough? So now consider that you also are able to recruit a new char onto your team on every planet (up to a maximum of 5), and that some chars, once their relationship is raised enough, will unlock ""Progeny"" chars, that the player will be able to unlock and use on the next run.

It's not over yet: with every successful battle you also gain Intel, that can be used in between runs to unlock new items/weapons... and there are a lot of those available to be unlocked.

If you managed to read this far, then don't be scared with the complexity, because the game actually does a good job on the tutorial, and the learning curve is well implemented - so you will be able to gradually get used to all those features I mentioned (and a few more I will leave unrevealed).

Recommended? Yes, for sure. Maybe the price is slightly high, considering it's still being patched (and developed).

it's a solid rouguelike title.

76762922,english,"I don't write many reviews , but I wanted to say a few things about this one.
The 'Rogue-lite' genre is in a lot of ways the perfect format for modern gaming. It has RPG elements but doesn't require hundreds of hours of repetitive grinding and saving over months to complete. It allows for experimentation, and improvements in strategies to try new things, and can be finished in one afternoon.
   Typically, the genre is challenging, and kind of a metaphor for life. You face the final battle and you might realize that it is not the choices you make in the final fight that matter. All of the choices you made earlier on mattered, and the wrong ones which seemed trivial at the time, resulted in a loss. Nothing save for luck, can make up for the fact that you needed to take certain actions or win key victories earlier in the game.
   When things are going well in your run, it's because drops, and battles all just seem to magically swing your way, and this massive positive momentum can carry you to a smashing final win. Nothing is determined in advance in a Rogue-Lite, unlike an RPG which can essentially be a long story where you simply go through the motions of grinding.
   Star Renegades has all of those elements in place, and on top of that it has an interesting learning curve, lovely art and awesome sound and music. If you make it through to the final win, you feel that you have really accomplished something difficult. I am still working on that win, but I know it will feel good , and not inevitable when I finally beat the game. If you are new to Rogue-lites, give this a go, and enjoy it.",1601388075,1601388131,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198013926999,52,3,8433,0,2961,1608475720,,
76756032,english,Just spent my entire day off playing this game and it is now  6:30 in  the morning and I'm already wanting to open it back up.

76745488,english,"Overpriced for what it is, which is bland style of substance, yet again.  There are too many choices that are left to random that make each play through seem, yet again, more about luck than about actual strategy. The battles eventually become extremely predictable on how to win,  yet since this is a game about random chance, if you happen to be unlucky to get in a battle with an enemy with buffs that seem a bit too perfectly aligned to keep you from winning.... well you probably won't. The battle interface has led to losses that otherwise would not have happened.

I could overlook the numerous flaws with this game, yet the absolutely terrible writing can't be overlooked. All the characters speak and react the same. I just don't care about the story for honestly it seems that it was tacked on as an afterthought. A game advertised as a story rich rpg ought to have a story, otherwise tell it like it is.

76738841,english,"TL;DR 8/10. Really fun core battle system. All of the negatives are things that I tend not to like in JRPGs so I find it hard to hold them against these devs. Looking forward to a second release if they ever do one.

 

Months ago I found myself wondering if RPGs would ever exist in the Rogue-like genre. I still loved RPGs, but had stopped playing them over the years since I found it hard to commit to 60+ hour games. So I was immediately curious when I first heard about Star Renegades because it seemed to provide exactly what I was looking for: party customization and progression distilled down to decent length.

 

The thing that makes this game shine and keeps dragging me back is the combat system. Rather than being purely turn based or action based it’s an attempt at each. There is a timeline for the battle and different actions will take different amounts of times. If you attack an enemy before they attack, then you will gain crit effects on your attack. And if they attack you before you attack then they will gain the same. One crit benefit is called “stagger” which will push their attack back on the timeline. If you push an enemy back far enough they will be completely off the timeline and won’t be allowed to attack this round! There’s something oddly addicting and satisfying about finishing a fight with 0 damage because the enemy almost never got an attack off!

 

From start to finish a run will take about 7 hours total. This run will take shape as picking your initial 3 party members, battling through waves of enemies, leveling up to learn new skills and equip new weapons, camping to build relationships and reap their benefits, beating a big bad boss, recruiting a new party member, and starting all over. In the end you’ll either die or kill off the big oppressor of this dimension and move onto the next dimension to start all over. I’ve completed 4 runs successfully at this point and sunk about 40 hours into the game, and I wouldn’t be surprised if I keep playing for at least 4 more wins!

 

The game isn’t without its negatives though. The thing which I dislike the most is just the general complexity of everything. Navigating to the equipment screen is awkward, it’s not uncommon for enemies to end up with 8+ status effects on them, deciding on your starting party and equipment can involve going back and forth between several different screens, getting a good grasp of how much damage the enemies will do can be confusing at times, etc. Honestly though, these are all staples of the JRPG genre and things that I hate in those games as well. So I find it hard to fault the devs for not designing them out. In addition, I have no doubt that there are fans of these mechanics who are thrilled to hear that there is plenty of complexity for them to play around with. So maybe I’m in the minority here.",1601339147,1601339147,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198119148228,25,1,3747,0,2802,1608496582,,

76711919,english,"Although I am giving the game a Thumbs Down I do so after giving the game every chance I could.  

This is a beautiful game.  It LOOKS great.  The animations are top notch.  The progression is satisfying enough -- think Darkest Dungeon except you can see the enemies and rewards around the corner.  The replayability is there if you enjoy the game play loop.  I've had an opportunity to take this game on multiple runs and while I haven't put everything together for a win yet I've learned something each time that has helped me get farther the next (except for one run where everything fell apart on the first planet but moving on).

So why the thumb down?  Four overarching reasons:

Writing: This is an RPG that is largely about menu based combat.  That's it.  The writing is there, and while it isn't awful it doesn't really DO anything either -- which is safe to say is partially to preserve exactly why you're playing again and again.  But even the character set pieces don't do much to develop anyone.  It's a strangely flat world with flat characters for a game with such a broad scope.

Gameplay: The gameplay loop can be very punishing if you mess up near the end because a run can take hours at a time.  There is some meta progression, but in the end if you die on one of the later bosses everything you did was for naught and you have to start over.  In other games with smaller bite sized gameplay sessions, like Darkest Dungeon, Isaac, or FTL, you can just lose and move on.  But a late loss here could be 4 to 6 hours of invested time scrapped.  In addition, the combat menus are bloated -- there's a lot of info on the screen but it's overwhelming if you're new.  There's a certain elegance to presenting complex systems in a way that is easy to digest and this game misses the mark.  Finally, part of this game involve navigating a map and different nodes with different encounters like in FTL -- which means that sometimes parts of the map close off.  What was frustrating for me is that there isn't much rhyme or reason to why sectors close off.  You can plot your course on day 1 and then later on get screwed and realize you left yourself nowhere to go in Day 3 -- including having zone bosses blocked off entirely.  The system arbitrarily invalidates player choice.  And one final annoyance in that vein: despite the game having a theme of running through multiple realities the game runs you through the same loop of the same planets in the same order with the same bosses and the same intra-planet map.  I know adding in variety takes a lot of time, effort and resources especially with the great work that has been put into the assets.  But I would love to see more variety from run to run.

Optimization: I'm running this game within spec but I've still had some performance issues.  I understand that it's very difficult to optimize a game for every possible PC layout in the world, so I can be forgiving towards Massive Damage.  However, despite this game revolving around pixel art it works my CPU and GPU much harder than other games that one would think would be more performance intensive.  This especially reared its head when I tried to stream the game and was unable to do so without a lot of choppiness and jittering.  And while it's true that streaming is a very individualized thing and performance greatly varies from system to system, if you're still reading this far I would advise you to make sure you test the game early to see if it works on your streaming setup.  It didn't on mine.

Bugs: this game has been out for weeks and there are still softlocks and reports of people losing saves.  I have fortunately not been a victim of the latter but I have encountered multiple soft locks in the following areas: transitioning between zones, after combat, and in one instance an introductory video (that made my PC fans run like crazy) that I don't even think was supposed to be part of the intro that just started playing.  I've persevered through these issues thus far, but I shouldn't have to be.  

I want to recommend this game.  But I can't.  I've played it enough to know that I want to like it but that it JUST isn't quite there for me yet.   I think I would enjoy this more if I could consume a full run in smaller chunks instead of being committed to one gauntlet through the same series of planets again and again.",1601301469,1601311054,False,31,1,0.686725318431854248,0,True,False,False,76561198014517085,440,11,676,0,676,1601270313,,

Сюжет, визуальная и аудио стилистика напоминают классические jRPG ранней линейки Final Fantasy.

Игровой контент ""рогалика"" вобрал в себя множество удачных механик последних лет:
- FTL; пусть вас не смущают цветные задники зон, они все также поделены на сектора с обжективами и на их исследование нам дается ограниченное количество действий.

-Into the Breach; закончить первый ран до конца практически не реально (если вообще возможно), поэтому придется гриндить глобальные обвесы и новых героев для своей пати, через проигрыши. Из плюсов можно отметить, что эта фишка хорошо сюжетно обыгрывается.

- ""Немезис"" система из дилогии Средиземья; редкая механика до этого встречавшаяся только в 2 играх, спиноффах про Властелина колец. Суть в том что на каждой зоне находится своя иерархия боссов со своими сильными и слабыми сторонами.Босс уничтоживший нашу группу или сумевший сбежать, в следующий раз получит повышение и встретится нам еще более смертоносным.

Понравилось то что игра вобрала в себя множество удачных механик роуглайтов последних лет и смогла заставить работать их вместе. 
Не понравилось: все механики представлены в усеченном виде и проигрывают оригиналам. Низкая вариативность геймплея, скорее всего после одного законченного рана на который уйдет ~20 часов, игра на долго отправится ""на полку"".

Заявленная цена в 465 рублей вполне оправдана. На ближайших распродажах, учитывая новизну и сдержанный успех игры, стоит ожидать скидку не более -20%.

Субъективная оценка 7.5/10. Не мастхев, но любителям инди стоит ознакомиться.

76612953,english,"Star Renegades is a roguelike turn-based combat-focused JRPG - from the people who made Halcyon 6. The story is basically ""aliens are invading"", and the roguelike mechanic is ""When you die, we send you to another dimension to try again"". In my first run I got to the last boss without too much trouble, then got absolutely flattened. That took 8 hours, which is way too long for a roguelike run so I probably won't be trying again. Art style and music are excellent, and the combat is generally a really cool idea, but let down my a confusing mess of a UI and information overload which makes me tired. Overall feels really unique, but I really hope they make the combat a little more streamlined.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Excellent soundtrack, good dialogue
+ Beautiful pixel artwork
+ Not serious, good fun
+ Lots of depth
+ There's a camping mechanic where your team sit down together at the end of each day and get to know each other (by playing card buffs). If you do that enough, characters level up in their relationship, and gain passive abilities, powerful combo abilities, and apparently can mate and create new team mates
+ Nice art effects of 2D assets but with depth

[b]Cons[/b]
- Forgettable characters. Literally can't remember any of their names
- Inconsitencies in how the UI gives information. For example, a combo move between anime girl and support robot guy (I can't remember their real names) uses both characters. But if you select the combo move from the robot guy, it'll say it does 114 damage. If you select the same move from anime girl, it'll do 154. Same ability.
- The information layout for combat is deeply confusing
- Moving around the map you have to keep clicking on the staircases instead of the final destination
- Too much info onscreen
- Too long for a roguelike

전투의 경우 타임라인형식으로 행동순서가 표기되며, 해당 적의 행동이전에 내가 공격하면 적의 행동을 지연시키는 것이 가능하다. 이게 핵심인데, 적을 공격해서 내 딜타임을 또 가져올 지 아니면 방어하고 한 턴 기다릴지만 생각하면 되기에 단순하면서도 퍼즐을 푸는 쾌감을 준다. 게다가 적의 수도 적어서 캐주얼하게 즐길 수 있다.

전투시스템도 좋지만 이 게임에서 가장 높이 평가하는 부분은 그래픽이다. 깔끔한 도트와 입체적인 배경이 게임 몰입도를 높여주고 턴제게임 주제에 박진감넘치는 전투를 느끼게 해줬다. 이 점만으로도 나는 명작까진 아니지만 수작이상급은 된다고 생각한다.

76526830,brazilian,"Star Renegades é um RPG Roguelite de estratégia desenvolvido pela Massive Damage e distribuido pela Raw Fury. Ele saiu dia 08/09 e já está fazendo sucesso por ai. Agora, eu te conto porque. Se preferir escutar esse review, você pode ver o vídeo aqui:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvsU2G4U03M

Em Star Renegades você é responsável por impedir a invasão do Imperium ""uma força devastadora que trará ruína e caos"". Mas fique tranquilo, devido as mecânicas roguelite, se você falhar - e você VAI falhar - você sempre pode tentar outra vez. Mas isso só é possível devido a inteligência do Prof. Zurek e presteza do drone J5T-1N. Caso você falhe, a lore do game explica que você é jogado de volta no tempo para uma dimensão onde a nave mãe, ainda, não dominou tudo.

Derrotar a nave-mãe vai envolver batalhar e destruir todos os seus generais. E cada vez que você falhar, eles serão promovidos por ter te derrotado. Mas você também irá ter a oportunidade de melhorar suas habilidades. Entre runs você pode desbloquear novos equipamentos, habilidades para o J5T-1N e ainda, novos guerreiros para lhe auxiliar na batalha. Ou seja, você nunca estará mal preparado por muito tempo!

Mecânicas
As batalhas em Star Renegades são, sem dúvidas, o foco do jogo. Primeiramente temos uma barra de tempo em cada turno, onde ficam dispostas as ações inimigas. Isso te permite calcular bem a melhor forma de lidar com cada turno. Ao selecionar uma ação de um aliado, ela, dependendo do seu tempo, irá aparecer em algum local da barra. As ações são executadas de acordo com a ordem de velocidade, após movimentar todos os aliados.

Contamos com armadura, vida e escudos. Efeitos como sangramento, stun e ignorar escudos. Combos e todos os elementos dignos de um bom RPG. A diferença fica em algumas movimentações especificas, como é o caso do crit e break, que basicamente definem a batalha quando usados corretamente. Infringir um crit significa bater no oponente antes dele executar sua ação, enquanto break acontece quando você atrasa tanto o ataque inimigo, que ele fica para o próximo turno.

Temos ainda, skills que gastam fúria, que se acumula ao executar outras ações. Essas skills não gastam o turno do seu personagem, e normalmente são compostas de buffs ou regens. Alguns personagens possuem ainda, auras de efeito, enfim… tem muita coisa pra aprender. Consegui derrotar meu primeiro behemoth, na primeira run, abusando, e muito, dos status de crit e break. Mas afinal, como se dão as runs?

Rogue
Em Star Renegades temos mapas dividos por áreas que te deixam, semi-livre, para decidir o seu caminho. Em cada dia do mapa, nosso querido J5T-1N pode adentrar em 3 barreiras diferentes (que separam as áreas) antes de descansar. Pelo mapa podemos encontrar inimigos, incluindo vários generais da nave mãe. Também encontramos caixas de equipamento, itens como regeneração de vida ou escudo, dinheiro e ainda, DNA. Já chegamos nisso.

A medida que avançamos pelo mapa, algumas áreas serão bloqueadas e depois de 3 dias, o behemoth fará sua aparição. Você tem esses 3 dias para explorar, se adaptar e, com sorte, sobreviver até a chegada dele. No final de cada dia, você ainda tem a chance de montar acampamento com seu time, e juntar alguns buffs para o próximo dia. Isso acontece pois cada personagem tem cartas que podem utilizar para dar buffs nos colegas.

Cada carta gasta certo número de ações, após o final desses pontos de ação, o próximo dia começa. O que nos leva a relacionamentos entre os personagens do time. Relacionamentos esses que, ao avançar, podem desbloquear ataques executados por dois personagens simultâneamente. Quando usados na hora certa, podem significar sua vitória.

Evolução
Além das melhorias que podemos adquirir no final de cada run, ainda temos como fazer uso do DNA e do dinheiro durante elas. O DNA é encontrado pelas fases e adquirido em algumas batalhas, bem como os créditos, o dinheiro do jogo. Usamos DNA exclusivamente para avançar o nível de nossos personagens, que irão ganhar novas skills, mais hp, mais escudo etc.

Os créditos podem ser gastos tanto entre mapas quanto entre runs. No caso, quando derrotamos um behemoth, avançamos para outro planeta e temos a oportunidade de gastar dinheiro para comprar equipamentos. Além disso, nessa troca de planetas, recrutamos mais um integrante para nossa equipe.

Entre runs, além do dinheiro. Temos outros dois recursos diferentes que podemos gastar em porção de melhorias. Mas é bom ter em mente que tudo desbloqueado aqui será adicionado a próxima run, ou seja, você não vai necessariamente começar com eles. Ambos recursos são adquiridos nas batalhas e exploração da run passada. Ou seja, quanto mais jogar, mais forte você será.

Arte
Por fim, não teríamos como deixar de citar a magnifica arte do game. Usando de sprites 2D e propriedades 3D, algo que normalmente não fica legal, o jogo fez algo realmente diferente e simplesmente lindo de se olhar.
Mesmo as animações, são perfeitas e rápidas, não empacam seu jogo como em outros game semelhantes. Apesar disso, temos a opção de avançar todas essas animações, algo que acaba sendo desnecessário. A trilha sonora também combina perfeitamente com o game. E sua única falha acaba sendo não ter português.

Afinal a história e os diálogos entre membros da equipe dão um charme a mais para o game, sem dúvidas. A custcene inicial garante que você vá, pelo menos, ficar curioso sobre o que está acontecendo no mundo do game.

Enfim
Fique atento, esse é um roguelite, e só por ele ter uma porção de coisas novas, isso não significa que essas coisas novas continuarão novas depois de 20 horas de jogo. Esse é um aviso que preciso fazer mesmo o jogo sendo tão sensacional. O conceito de roguelites é refazer tudo, de novo, e de novo, e de novo. Será que teria sido melhor se fosse um RPG linear? Talvez. Mas é um prato cheio para os amantes de roguelites que não se importam em avançar pouquinho a pouquinho por horas a fio.

Agora vamos ser honestos, preciso citar algo que me incomodou um bocado.A forma de inspecionar os inimigos e seus respectivos atributos. Ter um botão e modo só pra isso, e ainda assim mostrar tão pouca informação, não é legal… dito isso, acredito que esse seja um problema que pode, facilmente, ser aferido e consertado pelos devs com algum esforço.

Ainda assim os R$47,99 se tornam baratos quando constatamos a qualidade que o game apresenta em todos os aspectos. Se ele continuar tendo suporte para melhorias, sem dúvidas vai ser um 10/10. Tudo isso incluso, ele é, sem dúvidas um game de qualidade!",1601028291,1601028291,True,15,0,0.695342063903808594,0,False,True,False,76561198054869651,2757,108,250,0,124,1601224120,,

Combat is interesting, while every fight asks you the same question *how do i best stagger and damage the enemy while taking the least amount of damage?*, solving that puzzle is fun, and making compromises when you can't perfectly solve it is interesting
Characters and team comps are interesting and varied, yes there's a few roles you have to fill, but there are so many ways to do it, and so many ways to flex that you can fill those roles even if you don't have the perfect candidate for them
Presentation is great, the art is godlike but that goes without saying, sound effects are good, and some are really satisfying and sell the impact of attacks, and the music is nice, and oftentimes catchy

As for some complaints

The game could use a lot more QoL, there's a lot of controls that feel unintuitive, and a lot of information that feels like the game should tell you but it doesn't
For a rougelite there could be a bit more variety, you always go to the same planets in the same order, and fight the same bosses, it looks like the devs want to implement more planets but that's a ways off
You still get different fights, different loot, and different minibosses, not to mention different people in your team, so there's some variety but the game would benefit from a lot more
Some characters/team comps always do the same thing, the Saboteur might as well not have abilities other than blitz
Difficulty curve is weird, you either overwhelm enemies or they overwhelm you, and you don't regenerate health between fights, only shields, so you have to play in a conservative manner

这游戏的优点在于美术设计，还有战斗动画的设计，但也就仅限于此了。
如果说轻度roguelike算是优点的话，那确实是可以让人不像爬塔一样那么精密的计算，也能以相对轻松的状态打通；但是游戏中的很多细节上的设计缺陷，已经可以掩饰所有的优点了，甚至很多地方让人感觉不适：
1) 战斗时有几率会遇到敌人战斗行动不被显示的情况 然后选择行动后 战斗开始计时会跳过那个不被显示的敌人 结果因为那个敌人未行动而让战斗卡主。目前这个bug只遇到一次，但是遇到的结果就是只能放弃当前周目重新开始。
2）战斗大地图上移动到不同区域要靠走的，而这个移动本身没任何意义还会因为自动寻路的简陋导致被卡主，需要玩家在崎岖的地方要自己一点点移动过去。这甚至不如做成点一下直接解锁地图来的好，繁琐且无意义的操作难道只是为了让玩家多看几眼有特色画风的地图吗？
3）不同的区域之间移动是靠点击连接点，但是某些地图，尤其是第三张大地图中的隐藏地图：白色室内地图让人很难看清连接点，虽然习惯后不影响操作，但是初见的时候不知道从哪里走过去很让人头痛。
4）游戏本身难度不高，原因是战斗的方式本质是用最少的次数打断扛不住的伤害，吃掉可以抗住的伤害。这导致无论敌人是什么样的技能组合，其实玩家的战斗思路是不变的，这也是导致玩到后期会无趣的最主要的原因。怪物，尤其boss固定，导致打法千篇一律。现阶段只有被抓走的己方人员充当的boss不同带来些需要玩家特殊处理的技能，不过总体上依然跳脱不出叠debuff打断对方行动的思路。
5）游戏针对多周目，是给玩家解锁更多的英雄加成，解锁新装备（并且可以带一个已解锁的1级武器）。但是这些却没有让玩家去解锁的冲动。原因主要在于游戏里英雄虽然设计的每个都很有特色，但是碍于第4点的战斗思路的局限，好用的英雄无非就是那么几个，带其他英雄玩游戏也只是为了做好感度任务而已。而对于武器来说，除了特别关键的几个装备解锁了以外，其他的无用装备解锁了只会污染商店和宝箱，让玩家更难拿到自己想要的。再说到多周目的敌人难度，高难度只是增加了敌人的血量伤害，本质上对于战斗上的思路没任何变化，只不过是让玩家更精细的去选择装备，而这会突显出装备解锁了之后污染商店的感觉。

Combat seems grindy, with only the Commanders and Behemoths really standing out as opponents. For a roguelike with replay appeal a single game takes far too long - upwards of eight hours to get to the end boss, I've only gotten to world three which took 6+ hours.

I'm begrudgingly changing this to a positive review because I keep playing, but I worry that the core gameplay loop is too repetitive.

Update: Finally defeated the end boss. That took... a while. I suppose my gripe remains the same, that the combat is mostly centered around staggering opponents - denying them the opportunity to attack this round, and to get to the end you have to fight a LOT of combat rounds.

76448906,english,"Star Renegades takes a good idea and squanders it. It isn't worth the full price. At $5-6 maybe. $25 is a hard pass.

On the surface, the game seems like it should be quite good.
The basic gameplay, Grandia-style combat with a heavy puzzle element is quite fun.
The sprite work is quite pretty.
But everything else ranges from mediocre to awful.

Almost all of the game's problems can boil down to one thing: Star Renegades does not feel like it was playtested for user-friendly design.
The map system by which you navigate levels wastes your time, obfuscates paths, and is generally pointless.
The game does not explain any of its icons and has too many statuses and effects to easily keep track of.
The preview does not accurately preview all effects. The game points this out. Not accurately previewing everything is a huge, huge problem for planning purposes. The preview system breaks with: healing, defending, putting moves earlier on the timeline than what is already on, guarding, and status effects. It is extremely unreliable.
Any move that occurs at the beginning of the timeline happens immediately after you click it. This is unlike all timeline moves, which only occur once combat starts. When planning, this can accidentally screw you over big time.
You cannot see the stats, formation, moves or any information about the enemies you are facing. For first time through, this can be really, really bad for the player. In a game about preparation, it decidedly refuses to give you the information you need.
The status screens are a complete disaster. The information about any character's moveset and passives are displayed in a very clunky way. You can only see 3 at a time, you have to click and drag to see what they are, and they are only shown by icon (you have to hover over an ability to see what it does).
The camping is poorly implemented. You build bonds between characters by using their camp cards to interact. When they hit breakpoints, the characters unlock either strong passives or a combo move. These are very powerful and the need to balance them with the buffs you need to be effective in combat (massive shield buffs or +25-33% dmg are camping buffs you can use). Balancing them could be cool, but new characters come in with 0 bonds on anyone. So in reality, you just get your original 3-4 chars super beefy on friendship while the later ones languish because they are down 2-3 levels worth of camping. You can't see what the friendship unlocks will be either, which also greatly hinders planning. You can't even use higher tier camp buffs on characters on others unless they reach a high enough bond, so latecomers just get screwed.
The puzzle element of combat also falls off fairly hard, as characters generally have 1-2 moves that are head and shoulders above the rest. It becomes use each char's strong move, which is effectively their role, with all their other stuff being fluff for niche cases.
You are given the option to recruit one of two characters after each planet. The game does not let you see their stats, abilities, or anything. You choose based off a little discussion they have. This is not the information you need when making party composition choices.

The game does not feel good to play. It feels less like you are fighting enemies and solving combat puzzles and more like you are fighting the game's poorly designed, implemented, and presented systems.",1600894905,1600895126,False,5,0,0.522286415100097656,0,True,False,False,76561198011027477,335,10,1008,0,978,1600895166,,

I love the insanely high amount of things you can unlock and include on your next runs (new characters, alternate versions of already unlocked characters, weapons, passive abilities for your drone, etc.) 

Each run can take quite a few hours and if you die, you still can unlock things back at your base and you get to attempt at reaching the end boss again (the story/dialogues do change a bit every run, and the end boss does as well depending on who you beat previously)

It can be a very unforgiving game if you do not 100% understand all of the combat details-stagger, combos, buffs, debuffs, party comps, etc. However it is an extremely rewarding feeling when you are able to beat a certain boss that is giving you trouble, or beating that entire run - or honestly just unlocking a new character or alternate versions of characters.

76440214,brazilian,"Star Renegades já abre com o pé na porta e uma bela animação que irá dar o tom frenético de sua trama. Há um clima de drama e desespero na cena inicial, mas também serve para revelar a energia combativa de nossa protagonista, sua disposição para chutar bundas a qualquer custo e fazer o que é certo.

O que vem a seguir é uma grande pisada de freio. A desenvolvedora Massive Damage entrega uma jogabilidade baseada em decisões táticas e riscos assumidos, que precisará ser repetida inúmeras vezes. Prepare-se para conhecer o fracasso, rir na cara dele e retornar para mais uma tentativa.

[h1]Mate, Morra, Repita[/h1]

Os planetas livres do universo estão na mira de uma ameaça extraordinariamente poderosa. A armada que deveria proteger a democracia foi dizimada. Os invasores parecem invencíveis. O Imperium está estendendo suas garras e apenas um punhado de renegados tem alguma chance de deter seu avanço e, infelizmente não irão conseguir.

A primeira reviravolta da trama surge logo no início: o Imperium já ganhou, em diversas realidades. Seu vasto exército conquistou outras linhas temporais, mas uma cientista conseguiu enviar uma sonda para o passado, antes da invasão em larga escala e cabe a nós impedir que o destino se repita. Cada fracasso é um universo condenado e um salto quântico para outro universo. Se você acha que já viu essa trama anteriormente, não é um déja-vu cósmico ou subproduto de um entrelaçamento: essa é rigorosamente a mesma premissa do superior Into the Breach.

Sem dó nem pena, a Massive Damage pega a ideia, sai correndo e mistura com mecânicas que já apareceram também em outros títulos, como sistemas de amizade entre companheiros de batalha ou uma linha de tempo nas batalhas por turnos que nos remete a Othercide, para ficar em um exemplo bem recente. Felizmente, o que falta de criatividade em Star Renegades, sobra em carisma e execução.

Em troca de uma boa experiência, o jogo exige paciência do jogador. Atravessar fracasso após fracasso está no núcleo de sua concepção. Será necessário passar por uma longa sequência de batalhas relativamente fáceis, subir de nível, melhorar o equipamento, derrotar os tenentes do Imperium e então ser massacrado pelo chefe final daquele universo. O objetivo não é a vitória inicial, mas emergir cada vez mais forte em outra linha temporal.

[h1]Simpatia é Quase Amor em Star Renegades[/h1]

A Massive Damage coloca na fórmula roguelike gráficos que esbanjam charme. A arte é muito bem trabalhada e o jogo surpreende também ao exibir essa maestria em diversas cenas que vão além do mata-mata por turnos contra os inimigos.

Há espaços de paz ao longo da aventura e diversos personagens que interagem entre si. Combine diálogos divertidos com a beleza dos pixels e temos aqui um título que convida a continuar jogando, nem que seja para deleite dos olhos.

Star Renegades também entrega um sistema de combate com múltiplas camadas, sistema de fraquezas e resistências, habilidades especiais, escudos, armadura e mais. O conceito de linha temporal compartilhada dentro do mesmo turno, que também vimos em Othercide, é modificada em prol do jogador. Enquanto o jogo sombrio lá fazia das tripas coração para tornar a vida do jogador um inferno, esse aqui quer ver sua felicidade e sua mensagem final é de esperança: continue lutando que um dia vai dar certo. Portanto, é possível quebrar a possibilidade do oponente reagir naquele turno, sapecando ele de bordoada, por exemplo.

Sem a necessidade de posicionar seus soldados no campo de batalha e com um leque bastante interessante de perícias, as lutas acabam se tornando mais tranquilas do que se podia esperar. Não encontraremos em Star Renegades o xadrez de um Into the Breach ou a brutalidade de um Othercide.

Isso não significa que seja um jogo fácil. A batalha contra o Behemoth final exigirá personagens bastante evoluídos, tática em profusão e muita sorte. Além disso, cada tenente do Imperium que não é derrotado também retorna mais forte no próximo universo, virando um antagonista mais significativo.

Entre as lutas, é necessário acampar e fortalecer os laços entre seus renegados. Não chega a ser uma interação do nível de uma visual novel ou mesmo outros jogos táticos, mas adiciona diálogos interessantes e desbloqueia combos entre heróis que irão fazer a diferença na linha de frente.

[h1]Fúria Contra a Máquina[/h1]

O carisma do jogo, lamentavelmente, se dissolve quando você ouve a mesma piada ou comentário pela quarta, quinta vez seguida. Por melhor que seja sua jogabilidade, repetir as mesmas lutas, utilizar as mesmas táticas, atropelar os mesmos inimigos até chegar na batalha que realmente importa acaba se tornando cansativo bem rápido. Um pouco mais de aleatoriedade ou um ciclo um pouco mais curto poderiam favorecer Star Renegades.

Um pequeno detalhe negativo do jogo é seu elevado consumo de GPU. Para um título com gráficos que remetem à gerações passadas, há um bocado de processamento rolando. A placa de vídeo esquentou no meu PC de uma forma bem próxima do intenso Marvel's Avengers.

Com um teste rápido, constatei que Star Renegades estava usando 50% do processamento de minha GPU parado na tela de menu, antes mesmo de começar a partida. Há algo errado na otimização, não chega a ser um problema que vá fritar seu hardware, mas gera uma testa franzida e um bafo quente saindo do gabinete.

O Imperium deseja conquistar o infinito e será praticamente esse o número de conflitos que você precisará travar para derrotá-lo. Para quem tem disposição, Star Renegades garante horas e horas de gráficos bacanudos, batalhas repletas de efeitos e personagens divertidos. Para quem deseja um pouco mais de variedade ou menos suor, Star Renegades parece mesmo um monte de ideias recicladas com embalagem bonita.

76402164,english,"Quick:

1/5.  Good artwork.  Bad game-play.  Random and simplistic.  Bland, unfunny, and repetitive dialogue.  If this game didn't look so unique, I doubt anyone would claim to like it.

More:

This game looks great.  The artwork is somewhat interesting.  Everything else about it is horrible.  First, and foremost, playing this game is not fun.  The mechanics are simplistic, narrow, and boring once you figure them out.  I was confused about how to really play the game for several play-through attempts at first.  When I got more comfortable with playing and exploiting the game's mechanics... I was still unimpressed and frustrated.  It is both figuratively, and literally linear.  It feels like you're doing the same thing over, and over (because you are)... and that you're following the exact same path (because you are).

     The worst part about this game is that you have to repeatedly start from the beginning.  You have to read to the same lines of dialogue over-and-over again, and replay the same roughly 2 hours of game-play repeatedly.  I was not able to finish the game, and I have no intention or desire to do so.  The story is nowhere near interesting enough for me to slough through this, and it is not fun enough for me to set other better games aside.  

     Why are there so many mechanics that don't mesh well together, or make sense in this game?  This is a question I asked myself repeatedly.  Why do my characters often lose stat points when they level up?  Why are sections of the map locked after a period of time, when I'm already limited to the amount of time that I can spend on each map?  Why do the status effects have such a minimal effect on the enemies? 

     What I assume the answer to these questions to be, is the reason that I don't recommend this game.  Those choices are made to artificially lengthen the game.  As I've said before, this game would probably be around 2 hours max, if you could play it through once, without dying.  I can't be sure of this, because I didn't finish it.  However, I did make it to what I assume to be the final boss, in roughly 2 hours, only to lose because I had a forced tag-a-long character that had to survive.  Take note that this character was added to my party at the last leg of the game, and is only there for the purpose of making the game more difficult (artificially lengthening the game)... in my opinion.  The last thing I was looking forward to at the end of this game was an escort mission... yet there I was.  There is a very small amount of substance here.  The story is bland, extremely simplistic, and not fleshed out.  

     The difficulty curve is all over the place.  I think this is because the balance is out of whack.  Certain characters are extremely OP in comparison to other ones.  However you can only choose 3 characters at the start of the game, the rest that are added to your party are chosen randomly by the game.  This is another choice the designers made that makes no sense to me.  Unless I assume that it was done to artificially lengthen the game.  Bosses can have certain stats that make them almost impossible to defeat, while during other play-throughs you can breeze right through them.  Most of my play-throughs were nearly impossible, yet the one in which I came close to beating the game seemed ridiculously easy... that is, of course, until I was forced to escort a useless character into battle with me for contrived story purposes.

     You cannot grind efficiently in this game to get stronger.  Certain parts of the levels are locked off after some time.  The enemies or resources in those areas are lost when this happens.  This choice baffles me, when you are already limited to the amount of time that you have to complete the map in the first place.  Why are there additional restrictions placed on my exploration when there is an ultimate time limit already in place?  Bosses also can retreat from battle when you get them into low health.  I'm pretty sure that you get less resources when this happens, but I'm not sure, and absolutely refuse to go back and check, so I'll just lob that criticism out there as a 'maybe'. 

     This game is supposed to have a pre-determined battle system, in which you know what's going to happen in advance.  But it really doesn't, and you don't REALLY know what's going to happen.  Bosses can perform multiple moves at once before you have a chance to move, and completely ruin any strategy you had planned.  There are also times when you're given the indicator that you're going to kill the enemy, only for some status effect to remove that.  This battle system isn't pre-determined.  You're given a warning in the beginning of the game that certain effects can change the outcomes... but if that's the case... then why have a pre-determined battle system to begin with?  As I've said before, it doesn't mesh well.  

     This game looks great, but plays sloppy.  There were some good artists on the development team, I assume.  I have no other good things to say about this game.",1600816302,1600816725,False,5,0,0.472313433885574341,0,True,False,False,76561198953419762,130,38,1864,0,1599,1600847885,,

76389600,english,"I'm not usually one for Rouge-lites but this one has me hooked for sure. The basic gameplay loop is more than engaging enough to keep me coming back repeatedly, but the progression is also pretty good.  Despite a few minor gripes, this is definitely one of the better games in this genre that I've played (though I'm not usually one for this genre in the first place).

I'll get the complaints out of the way first.  Each planet gives you 3 days of 3 ""charges"" to access different areas of the planet.  There's always more than enough to get to the center of the map, the goal, with some leeway to hit a few key targets.  Each zone has a myriad of things in them from fights to party boosts and equipment (and sometimes multiple things).  The game has a nice balance of letting you choose how you approach the progress you make between leveling and gearing up, but some methods are more effective than others, with combat in general not being the most rewarding (which I think should be).  My complaint in this vein, however, is that while it makes sense to lock of some zones as you progress, the algorithm that does this is a little janky.  Having one extra charge unusable is annoying, but makes sense if you've snagged every commander and a few key zones, but I've had it lock me out of a full days worth of charges, which meant I was very underpowered going into the final planet.  Possibly a bug, but a clearer explanation of why and which zones you get locked out of might help here.

I do have a couple other issues with the game, but that's just my distaste for RNG reliant systems in general, so I'll skip over those, unless the devs would like specific feedback.  The game is still good despite my personal views on the subject so I'll leave it at that.

The game does a pretty good job of explaining the mechanics, with the exception of equipment.  Damage types are never explained (but easy to intuit) but tooltips on the status effects would be very helpful.  Even after all the time I've spent on this game, I'm still not entirely sure how some of them work.  That said, a tip for anyone reading this, stagger is king so concussion damage with stagger weakness and extended times is the easiest way to make a strong team.  Also, since the game doesn't explain it well either, the shield regen is broken into 2 categories: regen on turn, and regen on effect.  The on turn denotes itself, no need to lay that out, but the regen on effect wasn't as straightforward as I expected.  This has an effect on the 2 characters that can regen shields, but only on active abilities, not the passive aura that the Empath has (and on that note, I want to like the Empath but the Archon is the better healer without question, still unlocking progenies so this may be subject to amendment on my part).

And finally, the things I'd like to see added to the game, or a wishlist if you will.  More classes would be fun, but balance is obviously an important piece.  Mostly I'd like to see another healer for variation.  Second, the game gets fun at the end of each phase, and it's actually disappointing that you get to spend so little time with your top end team.  An infinite assault mode with ever increasingly difficult fights would be a great final cherry on top of this quite amazing game.",1600796858,1600796858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041469084,293,16,5696,0,3623,1609233585,,

Small review on this very nice game that is Star Renegades!
Discovered when it was released on Steam and had never heard of it before.

The game is a mix between RPG and Rogue Like, although it pulls more towards RPG for my taste.
Duration of my first run is 13h (Tutorial => End of cycle)


It is a small pearl that can be played without problem. I personally note some difficulty during menus and controls which are very messy in combat. However that didn't stop me from finishing the game in the first cycle.

The difficulty is to be discussed, I read in the ""Steam Discussions"" that some find it too hard, personally I finished it on my first run without problem or game over. I would have liked it harder to force myself to die and discover / exploit the latent potential offered by the Rogue-like side of the title.

Thank you and have a good game!

Bonjour à tous ! 

Petit retour sur ce jeu bien sympa qu'est Star Renegades !
Découvert à sa Sortie sur Steam et je n'en avait jamais entendu parlé auparavant.

Le jeu est un mix entre RPG et Rogue Like, bien qu'il tire plus vers le RPG à mon goût.
Durée de ma première Run est de 13h ( Tuto => Fin du cycle )


C'est une petite perle qui se joue sans problème. Je note personnellement quelques difficulté lors des menus et des contrôles qui sont très fouillis en combat. Cependant cela ne m'à pas empêché de terminer le jeu en premier cycle.

La difficulté est à débattre, j'ai lu dans les ""Discussions Steam"" que certains le trouvent trop dur, personnellement je l'ai fini dès ma première run sans problème ni game over. Je l'aurais aimé plus dur pour me forcer à mourir et découvrir / exploiter le potentiel latent qu'offre le coté Rogue-like du titre.

Merci et bon jeu à tous !

75766535,english,"After 30 hours of playing and several playthroughs on ""harsh"" difficulty I must admit, that the game lost its magic. The combat system is still very nice and maybe the biggest plus.
Also the pixel look is awesome and the music fits and is atmospheric.

But there are quite some downsides here, which could be fixed.
First it's the exploration of each map. You don't have the pretended freedom. After a few steps in the map some areas are blocked and so you actually can only chose a few steps and not explore or collect all the items or bonuses you want or need.

Another manko is the sometimes very annoying randomnes in combats. When your back line gets hit with AoE a few times (by mobs you cant reach) your run is surely over. Due to only a very few healing options these things break your neck.

Which brings me to my last point. The runs are very very long for a rouge-like (2-4 h), which makes it even more annoying, if you cant reach the heal pod on a map, because the area is closed or losing battles in the last area due to pure randomness.

The rogue-like elements have a nice touch, but there is not so much to unlock. Useless Updates for the Drone, new characters are ok and the equipment upgrades are semi-interesting, because it's hard to get good equipment and when you do it's random as well, so if you desperateley need defense items and the game only gives you swords (which none of your heroes can use), you just lose the interest.

76360385,english,"Excellent turn based combat with wonderful visuals and soundtrack. 

The Good Stuff First!
The art style and music are top tier. Visuals are immersive and consistent thought the experience. The world is believable and compelling to engage with especially on your initial run. 

The combat system is the best I've experienced in a turn based RPG in a long, long time and is easily the most memorable part of the Star Renegades experience. In many turn based games spamming offensive abilities and occasionally healing is enough to get you through the game, but that is not going to cut it here. The full array of your abilities will be needed to advance on your runs. Shields, defensive abilities, role specific characters, and offensive abilities with different types, timings, and Crit abilities add incredible variety to each encounter. That is all before factoring in the ability to level up characters and change their equipment as well as the camping mechanic at night that requires you to make decisions between healing and buffing your party. All of this leads to endless approaches to fights and character/ party compositions. 

Where the game falls short....
Is in limited dialogue and a story that is enough to hold the game together but lacks a bit of depth. It is somewhat creative in how it sets up for the rogue like elements of the game on failed runs but beyond that you'll remember the game for its visuals and combat and not its story or character development. 

Still, its obvious that Star Renegades was designed with the combat system, art, and animations as a core focus of development and in that regard they absolutely nailed it.

Star Renegades is pretty low on randomness, and especially on randomness that might just end your run even if you do everything well - this makes a stark contrast with quite a lot of other titles which are all about manipulating tons and tons of RNG rolls for the best overall outcome.

That's not to say the game is low on important decisions - there's still many tough choices to make (who to level, what gear to get, how to approach all the battles in the best order); but otherwise the low RNG factor is there - a good strategy will always work (for a given difficulty level), while a bad one will always fail.

If you enjoyed Into The Breach (another roguelike that's mostly about correct strategies, not dice rolls) - do play Star Renegades, it's a great implementation of a similar concept.

One minor nitpick I have to make about the game - a single run is pretty long, quite longer than FTL or Into The Breach runs (even if you skip all the combat animations). It's not really *that* long to be a problem, but still quite noticeable. Aside from that, and a little UI clunkiness, I'm finding other non-gameplay aspects (graphics, sound, etc) to be quite well-made.",1600708180,1600708180,True,7,0,0.579741358757019043,0,True,False,False,76561198030141391,674,27,870,0,870,1600707107,,
76338866,english,"An excellent Turn-Based Roguelike game similar to Darkest Dungeon, but set in Space and without all the eldritch abominations and doom and gloom. Not to mention, it has a magnificent pixel art style.

The combat is clearly inspired by JRPGs more so than American RPGs. Anyone familiar with titles like Final Fantasy and Grandia will recognize the Initiative Display, which lets you see enemy actions even before they act, and let you plan accordingly. It's a game about reactionary tactics, which makes the whole combat feel way more involved than simply ""Hit you, Hit Me"".

That said, although its inspired by Japanese Turn Based Games, it lacks in something this genre usually has: story. The trailer and even the tutorial are quite misleading, leading you to think you're gonna experience a Space Epic through the eyes of the flagship character, the Valkyrie Wynn. This couldn't be further from the truth.

The plot is absolutely silly and doesn't takes itself seriously after the Tutorial is finished. You're basically a band of mercenaries whose universe is under attack by a strange army of inter-dimensional invaders. To stop them, you have to prevent their army from destroying energy Cores located in different planets (which act as the game dungeons) by defeating bosses known as Behemoths. When your party falls, it's game over, and you have to start all over from the beginning, while being able to unlock more character classes, weapons and abilities that make you stronger each run. You do this by jumping into another dimension to try and stop the army there. Even though it sounds quite serious, it isn't. I haven't spent a single moment of the game without any dialogue being some sort of unfun meta commentary or cringey joke, but... that's OK, plot isn't what this whole game is about, it's strength is the gameplay department and it really delivers.

If you're looking for a game that will let you play through flashy, action-packed turn based combats without having to worry about endless exposition dumps and 10 minute cutscenes, grab this.

76305661,english,"Let me just start by saying, go find Loku's review, he nails why this game could have been great but falls short.

I very rarely review anything, and as this was a small company's game with clear passion put into it, I feel terrible giving a negative review, but there's too many aspects of the game that feel sloppy for me to recommend it, especially at the price point.

Loku covers some really important issues, but I'd like to add a few:

- It's like they didn't even try to make pathfinding in this game. You spend all of your time outside combat walking around the maps, but unless you are specifically pointing where you want your party to go in small steps, you're constantly getting stuck in the terrain. There's a ""reset position"" button to get you out of it, but is that really a suitable workaround?

- Certain design elements feel half-thought out: 
-- There's a currency for unlocking characters, which I blew through easily, and now I guess I'm just collecting that currency for the lulz? If there's any other use for it, it's certainly not obvious.
-- The ""shadows of mordor"" enemy leveling system is completely pointless and ignorable.
-- You can sometimes come across an enemy encounter that's unbeatable, (I faced this twice so far, 3/4 enemies with an AoE attack that you can't avoid and it wipes you out in the first turn, ruining your whole run.)
-- The maps and events seem to have their powerups, enemy placements etc randomly placed. It's not uncommon to load into a map, see something useful that's far from you and that is impossible to get to before the zone gets locked out.
-- I won't spoil the end boss, but it's utter bullshit. Feels unfair for the sake of artificially making it difficult

- There's little to motivate you to start a new run after failing one once you've unlocked a few characters. The things you unlock to help you aren't particularly exciting or helpful

- Loku touched on this, but it's one of the worst parts of the game and it needs emphasis: the writing is terrible. Like, really bad. I considered refunding the game after 10 minutes of the intro on this point alone. It can't decide if it's a serious game or a meme game, as it switches between expanding the game's lore and tossing out joke after joke that falls flat on its face.

It's really upsetting to me to have to come out and say all this, because I want to love this game, I really do, but all the gripes collecting in the back of my mind finally formed into a solid negative feeling about my experience with it.

A slick presentation can't hide a few problems, though:

The UI usability is bad. Navigating the menus and (especially) understanding who's doing what in combat is needlessly difficult and tedious. It took me way too long to figure out you can cancel an order that's already given, because you have to click on the characters *on the field* and not anywhere else. The button to do so doesn't show up unless you hover a busy character.

The writing's self-aware enough to be funny without overdoing it, and has some neat sci-fi ideas tucked in there as well.

The game doesn't feel quite finished in a few places, though. e.g. Tooltips are weird or wrong (the Scoundrel upgrades from ""Blitz"" to ""Bombs Away II"" -- I think maybe ""Blitz"" used to be called ""Bombs Away""...

[h1]爱套娃的复联[/h1]
帝国军队突然发动的闪电侵略战，被烧毁殆尽的家乡，流离失所的人们。尽管战士们竭尽全力浴血奋战，却最终还是被无情镇压……这就是《Star Renegades》一开始通过一个服务机器人展现给玩家的剧情故事背景。

假如你因为开头的剧情而误以为《Star Renegades》就是一款普通的线性JRPG游戏，那么恭喜你，成功地被“骗”到了。《Star Renegades》借用了平行世界的概念，由某一个已经被帝国毁灭的宇宙出发，穿越到另一个帝国还未发动侵略的平行世界，尝试阻止这场灾难，就像《复仇者联盟》里的复联，穿越平行宇宙，阻止灭霸，既视感满满。

一旦失败了，那么便会将服务机器人传送到再下一个平行世界，无限套娃。所以玩家看到的结束并不是真的结束，而是名正言顺的肝的传承。

每一个平行世界都会有所不同，这也是《Star Renegades》轻度roguelike的机制体现，从地图地形到敌人配置，从战利品到补给点，都会有所变化，玩家能从上一个平行世界的战斗中汲取一些经验，但又不能完全抄书式的照搬，保持了新鲜感。

[h1]是你，八方旅人[/h1]
之前颇有话题度的《八方旅人》，它那既新颖又传统的画面表现和战斗系统，着实让不少玩家眼前一亮，《Star Renegades》显然从中获得了一定灵感。

马赛克的像素风在细节上并不算很精致，但整体依然能很好的表现出科幻与机械感，场景环境该细的细，该粗的粗，虚实结合的画面镜头让游戏空间更具纵深感。

回合制的战斗简单易理解，没有条条框框的束缚，只需要了解游戏内攻击类型与行动条的机制，根据不同敌人的不同弱点，因人制宜地使用对应类型攻击，利用出手打断敌人进攻节奏，适当的时候放个控制眩晕技能，便能有不错的战斗体验（当然实力相差过多垓输的还是会输）。

[h1]奇奇怪怪的有趣设定[/h1]
《Star Renegades》的英雄属实不少，他们有着不同的职业特性和技能，但玩家一开始只解锁了固定的三个，需要通过多次穿越平行宇宙而解锁更多职业。解锁后便会将入反抗军，下次可以自由选择出战人选和搭配阵型。

在敌人方面，《Star Renegades》里有着一个“帝国”系统，别无他用，就是记录了玩家遇到的怪物信息，通常是敌军大将，当玩家一次次穿越平行世界时，“帝国”里的怪物信息会继承下来，而最为特殊的一点是，在上一个平行世界打败玩家的敌将，会得到晋升强化，是不是听起来很酷？

游戏根据每个阶段的任务分成若干个关卡，每个关卡都有多条路线可以选择关卡终点，和所有的roguelike地牢闯关游戏一样，通常只能选择其中一条线路，根据具体情况择优选择，也正是随机的快乐所在。

到了夜晚可以扎营，打仗归打仗，觉还是要睡得，扎营可以对队伍进行适当补给，并且培养队员之间的亲密度，亲密度高了便可以在战斗中使用高伤害的组合技。

[b]游戏画面[/b]

这款游戏，在像素游戏中，算是少有的画面表现不错的。不过整体画风偏美漫，显得有点「硬核」，所以说画面精美也没有错，不过这里画面「精美」也不代表大部分人能接受。相信大部分人都是更加熟悉日式画风的。不过，就算是这样，游戏画面还是值得称赞，虽然是像素风格但是处处透露出精致和用心。
 
[b]战斗系统[/b]

初见肉鸽系统，下意识以为是很常见的动作、战旗类游戏。没想到，居然是回合制游戏。回合制游戏本身就越来越少见，一方面快节奏的大环境下，回合制这种类似「老古董」的战斗系统，不得人心实在是太正常了；另一方面，回合制难出亮点，无论是打击感（不会真的有人在回合制游戏中找打击感吧？），剧情表现（你拍一我拍一的战斗方式，难免让演出效果打折扣），回合制都不算是很出彩的类型。不过，本游戏的战斗系统不是单纯的“你拍一，我拍一”的回合制，因为引入了组合技能和攻击延迟系统，经常可以做到绝杀。游戏策略性也主要是体现在这方面。

[b]游戏模式[/b]

游戏战斗方式主要是回合制不过内容上则是肉鸽上，不过基本上只包含了肉鸽的「内容随机生成」，不过这一点实在不能让人满意。
首先是内容上的刻板化。人物升级可选择性约等于没有，技能种类几乎也不多，加上高度重复的地图和怪物。能改变的只有队伍组成，导致每一场战斗都等于上一场战斗，审美疲劳来得太快就像龙卷风。不到半个小时的战斗就完全失去继续推进的动力，着实糟心。

[b]剧情拉跨[/b]

不能不说，剧情是真的拉跨。看着地图不少，基本上就是第一个地图打完了复制粘贴几遍就完了，还可以美名曰「rogue」。实在是有些让人失望。

76255160,english,"I rarely write a review but this game deserves it.

Star Renegades is a ""Time-based Strategy"" game (not turn-based because characters act accordingly to a timeline, like Othercide). Many powers and the winning strategy of the game revolves around moving your enemies outside the timeline, meaning they will not act during this timeline against you.

You have many characters to choose, each with their own focus, and you need to assemble a capable team to keep advancing in the game. However many items you can buy can make a not so good team become really powerful.  

But battles are hard and don't give much space to mistakes. You need to understand final damage, status, possible attacks to diminish enemy' numbers, staggers to break them to the next timeline or just deciding to Defend yourself against otherwise finisher attacks. 

Where is the fun in this game? Strategy. Battles are hard but that also gives you a feeling of power when you manage to turn the table against what at first seemed impossible, but with a clever use of all the tools you have available you can win. 

The learning curve may be too steep but once you get the main concepts of the game you can really have fun creating your own party compositions, exploring different alternatives to existing characters, unlocking new characters, trying strategies without healers, without tankers, with focus on breaking opponents, etc. 

You receive points to level up chosen heroes and credits to buy equipment, but they are limited so you need to spend them wisely.

The game is short but its value is in replayability and the exploration of different party-compositions and strategies.

Map are randomly generated, too. Besides bosses, not a single run is the same. 

Failing a mission doesn't mean all is lost. You get some resources per run that allows you to get some boons before your next try.

The game dialog is focused on satire (which is not my thing) and the story is pretty simple.  Nonetheless, the pixel graphics mixed with special effects are simply amazing and that makes the battles even more enjoyable.

At this time, there are still a few bugs being corrected and some things are not clear but the game is ready to be enjoyed.

If you like strategy games with a Time-line based combat with some real challenge, look no further and buy this.

76234653,english,"Star Renegades is a masterpiece. It's one of the best games of 2020 imo thanks to its unique fighting system.

The fights are turn based. In other turn-based strategy games every character has an initiative. In SR every MOVE has speed. On top of the screen you can see the timeline. The strategy to win is knocking back enemies attacks (making them slower) so they don't attack this turn. Every enemie/move has a max of how many times you can knock them back. 

It's a roguelite. You will die and you will need to start over. Especially 'til you fully grasp the mechanics and characters. Every time you die you can spend points to upgrade/unlock things. BUT the enemie who killed you will become stronger. Enemie's and especially bosses don't just stay the same. The ones you beat will be gone, but others will join. With this and procedural generated content every run is different. 
Overall there are 3 planets to beat and the final space ship. If you die, you'll need to clear every planet again. There is a map on the planet and you can move around for 3 days. BUT you can just break 3 barriers a day. Some points on the map will be locked if you don't go there 'til day 2 etc. This brings some strategy into it, too.

You start out with 3 characters from the Star Renegades. After every planet you can recruit another one. If all of them die, you start a new run and can chose your 3 starting characters. Throughout a run your characters can build up a relationship. They can be friends or even more. Every night, you can spend points and cards to strenghten relationships. The better a relationship is, the more bonuses they gain (for example a special attack, more shields etc.). 

That's basically how the game works. It's definitely worth full price if you are into strategy games and don't dislike roguelites. I reviewed many games as of now and i don't say ""masterpiece"" to many games. This is definitely something special and i really hope they add more content / dlc's to it.

作为一个 Roguelike 游戏，随机的成分并不是特别多，地图虽然是随机，但是 Boss 和资源变化并不大。在每次旅途中会有装备，等级，和队友互相之间的好感系统。这个养成系统感觉是很 RPG 的。但这个 RPG 是在 Roguelike 的框架下，也就是每次死亡，装备，等级，好感都会重置，需要重新获取。由于回合制的节奏，以及 RPG 的机制，每一把的时间都特别长，大概在三个小时左右，这还是打到一大半的位置。

地图与其他简洁明了的 Roguelike 不同，这款游戏并没有地图，取而代之的是 2D RPG 游戏的那种设计。玩家可以在区域内走来走去。整个大区域被划分成更加细小的区划，通过限制玩家进入新的区划的次数来限制玩家的行动点。整个大区域的设计更像是图，而不是 Slay the Spire 那样的树。Star Renegade 通过这种方式更好的展示了游戏的美术设定，玩家也可以与区域中的一些物品进行互动，从而触发一些关于背景文化的对话。这样的坏处就是玩家不容易看清图的结构，游戏的节奏也会被拉慢，因为玩家在游戏战斗之间需要探索。

游戏中独特的扎营机制也放缓了游戏节奏。消耗完三个行动点，玩家就需要扎营，等待新的一天。在扎营期间，玩家可以培养人物之间的好感，使用各种 Buff 的卡片。

相比 Slay the Spire，选择节点，打怪，选择节点，打怪，这款游戏的节奏慢了很多。打一把需要更长的时间。那么每一把之后，玩家会变强从而在下一次走的更远吗？我个人觉得不怎么会。每一把之后的结算所能获取的东西并不多，我至今还卡在第三关。每一次花费两三个小时来到第三关，然后死亡，然后重来，最后放弃。我想这是游戏节奏的问题，又或者是去掉 Roguelike 可以解决的问题。",1600479773,1600479773,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,False,False,False,76561198316349332,233,8,670,0,568,1607287967,,
76193348,english,"**Gift from my brother.  Thanks dr.krules!

tl;dr  Manage the stagger charges on your enemies for best results.  

Description:
A game that mashes many random systems seen in other titles into a perfect blend of tactical turn-based RPG rouge-lite.  

Game is tough, but taking your time to really think about your turn orders, and designing your party to ensure your heavy hitters can get crits in before the enemies do.  You can't just wail away with your strongest stuff all the time, so each character gains a mess of themed abilities that are a balance of different benefits:  raw damage, bonus shield damage, armour break, 

Items are intersting.  Most tend to have some sort of debuff ability.  They also can have a wide variety of passive bonuses that can be used either to tank up your characters, increase damage vs. health/shields/armour and even drain any of the three to heal your character.  Some items increase stagger which can make existing stagger abilities far more efficient, or 

Camp cards offer a choice between passive buffs for a couple fights, permanent buffs, healing/repairs, etc...  but also have a relationship component.  As relationships grow, they allow the partners to make use of additional passive bonuses depending on who that partner is...  Some characters can become even closer, and maxing those out will unlock new characters and hybrid classes.  

Con:
UI is hard to use with mouse and keyboard.  Controller feels a bit better, but there are some dumb choices with regards to how to cancel actions.  Selecting targets with the mouse can be very frustrating due to how sprites tend to overlap each other.  You can use the portraits in the bottom to get around it sometimes, but not always. 

Beginner Tip:  Best item bonus early on is increased stagger amount (5s, 10s, etc), especially on the characters that start with a fast AoE like the Archon (uses gloves), who is also one of the starting characters.  Also works really well single target delayers like the Sabateur (who you also start with, uses pistols).  Higher stagger value abilities make more efficient use of your limited stagger charges on the enemy, especially bosses. 

Medium Tip:  Some of the bosses are really rough.  This is the first RPG I can remember where you actually have to make smart use of defend abilities to ensure you keep enough health to survive a long fight.  If that boss is out of stagger charges and is about to land a huge AoE, it might be better to have the whole party defend and eat it in order to set

Advanced tip:  Those same tough bosses have limited stagger charges and can hit HARD.  They often alternate between AoE and Single target attacks.  Sometimes it can be useful avoiding using stagger charges on an AoE ability if it's targeting your tank, and letthing them defend.  Each time an enemy attacks, it gains two more stagger charges which you can stockpile for REALLY dangerous abilities. 

Conclusion:  Game literally feels made for me, as I love these systems in all the games I'd encountered them previously.  Now I get them all in one game. 

9/10 - the UI can be pretty annoying, but the rest of the game is too good for that to take away from my enjoyment.

76164068,english,"This is a great game that has a few crucial gameplay issues that I hope will be resolved in the future.

The pros:
- art is superb
- the combat is tight and puts you on the edge of your seat; every decision is crucial
- the game loop is super long, for a rogue like, its something I appreciate.
- the audio is good
- the progression systems are complex and interesting

The cons:
- very bad UI; the inspect mode should be merged with the normal mode so all the relevant information is displayed on screen during combat; having to switch modes constantly, every turn to plan moves is unnecessarily time consuming. 
(I believe this could easily resolved with reducing the font size in the game)
- Very bare bone description of effects of buffs/debuffs
- No zoom out on the overworld makes the process of planning the route frustrating and time consuming. The overall experience on the overworld is poorly optimised. It would have benefited from just being select mission screen, with some missions being locked behind others. The fact your pathing makes you collide with terrain is annoying. 
- its hard to know where to click to bring up tooltips. 
- I play with a mouse, and when I navigate menus, I have to route my cursor in certain ways so as not to highlight other elements, or else my original objective is no longer available (this happens during combat when analysing enemy traits/effects)
- again on the overworld, I cannot scroll down without putting my cursor on the left side of the screen. The menu bars on the lower right side of the screen disable the cursor scroll... 

Despite all these quality of life problems, all in all I recommend the game. So that says something about what they did well :) .

I have my fingers crossed that they make some critical changes and take this game from a 6.5/10 to  a 10/10 that it deserves to be!",1600427194,1600459505,True,6,0,0.574724495410919189,0,True,False,False,76561198013248161,110,8,3337,0,719,1601245173,,
76182851,english,"Overall rating: Pretty darn good / 10.

Pros:
-Turn based RPG style combat is solid and satisfying. Takes a lot of the prediction and puzzle elements from Into the Breach, scratched that same itch for me.
-Big roster of heroes to pick from. People with giant swords in exosuits, murderous (but friendly (to you)) robots, and time traveling assassins save the galaxy from dimension-shifting evil empire.
-Loads of items that wildly change gameplay style for some characters. Getting an item that makes your AOE attacks instant and do more stagger might have you turn your healbot into a dedicated stunning machine. Or maybe you get a sword that puts a massive damage increasing debuff on the enemy, so you need to start using their super fast moves to get it first in the attack order.
-Art style is on point both in combat and out.  Gets a little noisy during fights on the final zone though, having 6 party slots filled means the left side of your screen is packed with sprites.
-Challenging but not stupid on base difficulty, modifiers can ramp it up pretty high though. It's certainly possible to win on your first run through, but unlocks and progression give good replayability.

Cons:
-Combat information can be dense and a little buggy, especially when it comes to when enemies have a counterattack or reflect damage. Not game breaking, but you have to parse through weirdness occasionally.
-Writing is weak besides the little scripted segments between heroes. There's obviously a pool of shared random text lines for various events, so people with entirely different personalities will end up repeating the same line about wanting to touch the giant mushrooms.
-Some general minor bugs and rare areas where framerate inexplicably tanks
-Unpolished in some areas, like the awkward jump to the ""You won!"" kickstart backer cantina immediately after beating the final boss, only to go back to the little ""...but the battle continues!"" cutscene. 
-The ""Shadow of Mordor"" style enemy generator just didn't pan out for me, the two times I lost to someone who wasn't an end boss and they got a promotion I handily murdered their ""upgraded"" version the next time through. Power progression is pretty spikey and sometimes it's not just that they were particularly strong, just that you were getting crap items for their specific resistances.

Recommendations to the creators if you ever plan an expansion or sequel, do what Hollow Knight's team did and hire a writer to build up the character dialogue and fill in the universe a little.

Combinar combates por turnos con roguelite, sumando una hermosa y trabajada estética pixel art y cuyo el resultado final es Star Renegades, un titulo que a primera vista llama mucho la atención pero que también es realmente disfrutable y desafiante de principio a fin, e incluso añadiendo algunas mecánicas interesantes que mejoran aun mas la experiencia.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2225179708

Cabe destacar desde el principio el excelente sistema de combate que presenta bastante variado y muy exigente desde el principio que nos obligara a aprender a combinar de manera muy efectiva a los personajes llevemos en cada aventura la cual empezaremos con 3 hasta un máximo de 5 y 1 al que al final deberemos proteger, y que ademas deberemos aprender a manejar el orden de ataque o acciones ya que el combate implementa la mecánica de linea de tiempo en el cual se determinan el orden en el que se desarrollan las acciones de nuestros personajes y enemigos, y en el cual mediante algunos ataque de nuestras unidades lograr retrasar a nuestros enemigos e incluso enviarlos al siguiente turno. También he de aclarar que cada enemigo cuenta con un numero limitado de retrasos que podemos hacerle y que se nos muestra en la barra de tiempo.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2224224842

Luego tenemos la parte de exploración en mapas que se van generando de forma procedural los cuales se dividen por secciones, en donde tendremos 3 accesos a esas secciones por turno o por ""día"" que cuando se terminan entraremos en el campamento y usar cartas que nuestros personajes poseen para obtener beneficios y mejorar la relación entre los personajes, consiguiendo mas estadísticas y la posibilidad de utilizar una combinación de ataque o ""ultime"" de gran poder de ataque, una mecánica similar que vi en el juego Mistover. Ademas en los mapas podremos encontrar mejoras para nuestras unidades, monedas para objetos o adn que sirve para aumentar de level nuestros personajes para así desbloquear habilidades y estadísticas, y nuevas cartas. Por ultimo también encontraremos a una gran variedad de enemigos, que van desde los normales, mini jefes y por ultimo al terminar los 3 días enfrentaremos a los jefes de área que son increíblemente exigentes y que mas de una vez fui derrotado por ellos. Aquí se agrega otra mecánica que es básicamente el sistema nemesis de Shadow of Mordor, donde el mini jefe que nos derrote aumenta sus estadísticas y cambia de escenario.La parte roguelite viene cuando somos derrotas, perderemos todo el progreso realizado pero iremos desbloqueando algunas ventajas para nuestros personajes y en los escenarios.

Por ultimo me queda por destacar su increíble y trabajada estética pixel art la cual es una de las mejores que he visto hasta ahora, sumando también el gran nivel es las animaciones de los personajes e incluso los escenarios cuentan con un excelente nivel de detalle.

这是一款像素风格的轻度Roguelite角色扮演游戏。
作为一款像素风格的游戏，画面相当的不错，美术风格感觉就是典型的歪果仁模仿日系画风的那种感觉。游戏的战斗画面非常出彩，玩起来让人觉得非常有打击感，人物动作非常流畅，游戏的战斗特效做的非常华丽。可以说在像素风格的游戏里面，这样流畅的战斗是很少能体验到的。
游戏的剧情说的是敌人可以穿越维度，所以玩家在当前时间线失败了也没事，可以去别的时间线继续消灭敌人。大体来说就是将玩家不停失败重玩的过程变得合理。
具体剧情？拯救世界就是了，基本上算是可有可无。游戏的主要玩法是回合制，玩点是推迟时间轴的机制。
简单说明一下的话就是敌人的攻击顺序是可以推迟的。举例说的话，原本我方女主的的行动顺序慢与敌方士兵，但是我方其他人的攻击速度最快，那么在他攻击玩敌人之后，敌人的行动顺序会向后推延，这样，就会变成女主的攻击速度也比敌方快了
。游戏还有一个暴击的设定，那就是我方人物如果攻击顺序在敌人之前，那么就是必定暴击的。所以想要让敌人没法攻击，基本上的办法就是让敌人的行动一直被推延，直到干死敌人为止。
而且除此之外，游戏还设定了敌人的弱点，比如有的敌人畏惧重击，而使用重击攻击敌人就更能推迟敌人的攻击时间，而且还能造成更多的伤害。
回合制？从这点上来说，我觉得策略玩法的占比更高。至于游戏的Roguelite，游戏的大地图是随机的，基本上就是每个地图给玩家两条路线选择，玩家行走路线不同，遭遇到的怪物强弱有区别，获得的道具不同罢了。不过怪物数量总体稀少，差别不大，而且奖励也因为种类比较普通，基本不会带给你带来杀戮尖塔那种组好卡组就一路C到底的强烈快感。
再加上每个英雄的人物天赋和升级奖励是固定的，所以技能种类是很少的。玩家唯一能改变的也就是队伍构成--选择不同的队友。
所以玩了几关之后，我就觉得游戏的流程太过于雷同，每场战斗打起来都差不多，很快就觉得无趣了。
再加上敌人把我打死也会升级，而且升级速度比玩家快，也就是说游戏会越来越难，这就让战斗更加磨蹭，实在难受。
至于游戏还带有连招或者两个感情好的英雄可以生下子嗣作为新英雄，这些玩法都只是添头，这里就不在多提。
游戏有中文，翻译的还不错。

7/10
就目前来看，游戏最好的地方就是战斗特效了，内容上来说，地图少，流程短，战斗重复性高。
基本上第一个大地图打完了，游戏的全部内容也就差不多体验齐了，剩下的都是重复内容。
只说画面的话，对比八方旅人，这游戏两方的价格也还算不错。
喜欢RPG和策略游戏的玩家可以尝试。普通玩家请等待50%off。",1600312420,1600413883,True,3,0,0.13397526741027832,0,False,False,False,76561198060688156,8942,489,177,0,177,1600308145,,
76155742,english,"It's rogue-lite, what did you expect? It's not completely random, but it does have strategic depth. You do get more variety as the game goes on and you unlock things. There aren't leveling branches for individual characters, but you do get progeny from maxed 4 heart companions that are either new classes (there are 4) or variants of the base characters with slightly different abilities/level unlock orders. You also unlock character perks to select from with intel that can buff a character from the get go. It's okay to lose a game, you get resources and hopefully a progeny or two unlocked. I beat it on my third attempt with a team of Aegis, Marksman, and Saboteur. I later got Valkyrie and Empath to join my team as I beat the 1st and 2nd behemoths. Your team's composition is important, but not rigid. I do recommend starting with a tank, a staggerer, and someone that can shred armor. I'm on the final ship on my 4th playthrough on the new harder difficulty with an entirely different team of Juggernaut, Saboteur, Commando, Paragon, and Archon. It is a hard game, but not like others where you just abandon a run just because you started with bad items. 

In terms of presentation, I find the art style and the special effects pretty good and unique. The music and sounds fit, but I'll probably start playing while listening to something else. It's not bad, but it's not particularly amazing either. The writing makes sense enough for the rogue-lite nature of the gameplay. I found all of the characters so far to be quirky and endearing despite being obviously memey in nature. It does seem like overworld dialog on the planets is not unique to each character class unfortunately. A bit of a mistake there imo. 
 
My only major complaints with the game so far, is that while the enemy variety is pretty good and the sub-bosses do change, the behemoths are the same every time at the end of each world. Hell, the 3rd one follows the same attack pattern every time it feels like. I am way more cautious of the sub-bosses than the behemoths now funnily enough. Another complaint I have is with fleeing sub-bosses. While do-able, my current team of Juggernaut, Commando, and Saboteur were pretty bad on the 1st world. All of the sub-bosses ran away from me on the 1st world because I couldn't kill them fast enough once they initiated their retreat. It was very frustrating, but didn't gimp me too hard I suppose. You can delay the retreat with a stun but they still try to run the next turn if you couldn't kill it. 

Major kudos on the final boss fight though. Mechanics of the fight literally made me :O So did the ending. :O I feel like there is a pretty satisfying game loop with this game.",1600409166,1600409938,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069619221,215,30,6265,0,1477,1607749794,,

76062607,russian,"Star Renegades – это хорошая игра, но пройдя её 2 раза я испытал некоторое разочарование.
Изначально она привлекла меня трейлером – отряд из 3 героев храбро сражался с огромными врагами в красиво нарисованном пиксельном мире. Давно не играл в пошаговые ЖРПГ бои вот и купил в день выхода. И так как я практически не встречался с багами, о которых то тут то там сообщают, то игра в большей степени мне понравилась, но учтите, что баги тут есть, как и проблемы с производительностью, забагованы например ачивки, лично я недополучил пару штук. 

Итак, игра представляет собой пошаговый рогалик с пошаговыми же боями и случайной генерацией всего, кроме карты – карты меняются с победами в сессии. Тут есть как линейные территории, где вы должны по 1 из 2 путей дойти до цели и одолеть её (это 1 уровень в каждой сессии и побочные ночные случайно выпадающие миссии), так и «открытые» территории, в которых вы сами выбираете путь. На таких картах у вас будет 3 дня по 3 действия в каждом – каждое действие это открытие определённой выбранной вами территории, но выбирайте с умом, потому как каждый день некоторые области становятся закрытыми и на следующий день вы на них уже не попадёте, а там могут быть полезные предметы, включающие в себя: 
Вещи 
кредиты 
аптечки 
станции с ДНК (это ваш опыт) 
автоматы с едой, дающие вам карточки для лагеря (на мой взгляд ни о чём) 
а также станции починки (а заодно и увеличения) брони и щитов 

Также на открытых локациях вас будут ждать конечно же враги и боссы – каждый со своим набором особенностей (защита от какого-то урона или восприимчивость к нему, ненависть к определённым действиями и атакам, от которых у них сносит крышу и они отвечают мощнейшим ударом и т.д.), побеждать которых очень нужно, ибо они сторожат ящики с продвинутым снаряжением, которое КРАЙНЕ полезно и нужно в игре, кстати в ящиках всегда лежит то, что подходит хотя бы 1-2 членам вашей пати (если не по уровню, то по типу), что приятно. 

Сама боевка тут крайне хороша – она пошаговая, но также действия бойцов имеют шкалу инициативы, а враги сообщают о своих намерениях, что даёт вам возможность прервать их действия или убить их раньше, чем они нанесут удар. У вас в распоряжении множество скиллов с разнообразными эффектами и вы должны думать, стоит ли отодвигать кого-то по шкале действий или позволить им нанести удар, если вы сможете его выдержать. 
В конце каждого дня вам позволят разбить лагерь, подлечить героев, раздать им баффы и укрепить их отношения, дабы они получили бонусы и совместные убер-атаки, которые реально решают на поле боя и проводятся мгновенно, что важно. В конце 3 дня на каждой планете вам предстоит сдать экзамен – победить исполина, который действительно силён и требует понимания ситуации и способностей ваших героев, дабы грамотно ему противостоять. Есть прокачка героев до 10 уровня с открытием способностей и получением характеристик.
Когда игровая сессия закончится – поражением или победой вам предложат открыть перки для героев, или открыть самих героев, новое снаряжение и способности для дрона, которых всего 3 а активировать можно только 1 на забег. 

И вот тут игра меня и разочаровала. Мета-геймплея мало, открывающихся героев тоже – всех возможных для открытия я уже открыл и опробовал, но есть ещё 4 скрытых портрета, которых я не знаю, как открыть и это меня убивает. В конце концов, мне игры хватило только на 5 сессий, 3 из которых я продул, а 2 затащил и, по сути, тот самый цикл, который мы должны разорвать – не особо то и разорван. Т.е. да, разрабы дают понять, что истинно-истинная концовка ВОЗМОЖНО откроется тогда, когда мы пройдём игру столько раз, сколько всего есть играбельных героев в игре, но мне уже хватило. Играть раз за разом со слегка изменённой партией (ибо есть герои, без которых никуда – тот же «хиллер» архонт) уже не интересно, при прокачке нет какого-то выбора способностей хотя бы из 2 вариантов, а значит это всегда будут одни и те же персонажи, да и концовка не даёт закрытия гештальта – мы вроде, как уничтожаем имперцев, но потом прилетают новые, и их МАТЕРЬ находится вне нашей досягаемости. 
В общем, какое-то время эта игра очень даже развлекает и увлекает, а потом ты понимаешь, что сюжетной глубины нет, сессии более-менее похожи друг на друга, а истинная концовка если и есть, то переть до неё слишком долго. А ещё тут ОЧЕНЬ въедливая музыка, я бы не сказал, что она прям хороша, но мой мозг не может от неё избавиться уже неделю.Но в целом я игру всё же рекомендую, потому что боевка достаточно нова для жанра, пиксельный графон с 3д перспективой прекрасен и по началу это очень увлекательно и свежо.

76152474,english,"It pains me to say this is a bad game. I really, truly, fully want to love this game. It has great art, a lot of charm, the developers clearly love their product, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.

The problem is, it's not a fun game. Having to get reset back to the start and go through the whole line of planets again and again isn't fun to me when NOTHING changes between each run besides what's on the map for you to harvest. 

The dialogue, the bonuses, the bosses - all remain the same. The nemesis system they use is just a glorified level-up. They don't call you out, they don't look any different. Just some buffs.

It's a game that has everything in it that I love, but executed like a wet fart.",1600401478,1600401478,False,34,5,0.574724972248077393,0,True,False,False,76561198020109566,279,46,393,0,393,1599934443,,
76152143,english,"There’s a thing in boardgames called quarterbacking. It’s what happens when someone (usually the owner of the game, or someone who has played the game a lot) tells everyone what to do to the point of micromanaging other player actions. They see the optimum path, and try to tell the other players what steps are needed to achieve victory. As you might imagine, being someone at the table being told what to do every step of the way is a little infuriating, and tends to cause a fairly negative play experience. 

The reason I bring this up is that Star Renegades is 100% the game for people who enjoy being ‘the quarterback’ in conventional board games. If the idea of looking at a complex puzzle, and not only lining up the right pieces, but also the timing of said pieces, is really enjoyable to you: the gameplay formula in Star Renegades is a great way to scratch that itch.

While there is a very tiny bit of randomness (enemies acting at the start of the turn before you get to respond), a lot of this game will feel like your fault/ triumph as you push on. If you manage to figure out the combination that gets your ragtag band of heroes through the boss fight, it’ll be because you saw the right steps, and adapted appropriately. If you fail, it’s generally because you made an error somewhere; and the game comes in seeing the problem before it happens.

I particularly enjoyed the relationship building component of this game. So much so that I usually skipped ideal buff/ role combinations in favour of ‘I just want to see where this story goes between these two’. The repetitive cycle/ reality nature of the game means that the plots are never very deep, but heroes are unique and evocative of their personalities so you always want to listen to them grow. 

The game is not without its faults though. For a system that’s built on understanding that skill sequences of A-B-C will work substantially better than B-A-C, the UI could be more helpful in telling you this. For instance, if action A will hit for 50 damage and trigger at 10 seconds, the timeline and health bar predictions updates accordingly, but if you then go to schedule action B which will debuff the defense of the enemy by 5% at the 5 second mark; that calculation doesn’t seem to go into effect unless you reschedule Action A. With high disruption/ debuff/ buff characters typically being in the back row (and thus the last ones selected), I’d often start setting up my timeline with front line fighters, only to have to redo them after getting through back line actions. 

Other little issues include things like the Empath’s time aura/ stimulate ability not working if you use them first (vs. using them after scheduling other characters), or why combos between two characters do very different damage based on which of the two in the combo you picked first. These are minor and I’m guessing it’ll be sorted in good time. I was able to get around these little items through changing my behaviour a little, and I haven’t had a crash in 60+ hours of playing.

Star Renegades may be one of my favourite games of the year. It’s got a great sense of humour, plays to a theme that I find close to my heart (parallel universes and the heroes that save them), and a great gameplay formula that keeps you going ‘one more turn’.

You can only start with 3 characters eventhough your line up maxes out at 6. I could have live with that but it doesn't allow you to carry over any gear, except a level 1 unlocked gear for 1 character. I  tried abandoning a boss battle so 2 or 3 characters survive. I thought they'd give the opportunity to bring them over to the next dimension attempt but that isn't allowed. They don't talk to you and as far as I know won't even give you the option to carry over any of their gear, even 1 piece. This seemed odd to me and unreasonable. They are alive. If they died during battle, fine. They left the gear in the battlefield. So just from a narrative standpoint, it seems these survivors aren't even bothering to help you in the next dimension.

I was pleasantly surprised, and Star Renegades is a prime example of why I love the roguelike/roguelite genre so much. It's always full of surprises and gems. I love the art style.. really one of the draws that feeds my impulse each time to open this game up. The animations are amazing. The games got a nice feel to it.. reminds me of the original Risk of Rain.  And the combat.. it's a solid JRPG turn based combat system. It's smooth, tactical, and rewarding.I do agree with some of the negative feedback this game has gotten so far. I do agree the game can start to feel repetitive, but I found playing the games in shorter sessions keeps it fun and exciting for me each time I pick up the controller.

A title that has enjoyable gameplay that’s hooked my attention for sustained periods of time, which is a rarity for my taste. That being said, like most games, whether someone “likes” or “dislikes” it, mainly revolves around what you as a player enjoy.

[h1]Core Gameplay Loop[/h1]

Star Renegades uses a roguelite formula with JRPG-type combat. For well-known games you can use as conceptual references, I would include things such as Darkest Dungeon and Battlechasers, but mixed with common rogue elements as seen in Into the Breach, Chrono Ark, and Dead Cells. Each run takes approximately 6-8 hours (depending on how quickly you play, and how familiar you become with the game) to beat the final boss. You’ll venture through an intro section, 3 planets, and the enemy’s main ship for essentially 3 main zones with a finale on the ship which is much more abbreviated compared to the planets.  Between each zone, you’ll have the opportunity to buy equipment at vendors using a temporary credits currency and recruit one more hero for your crew. Therefore, this means that for each of the planets, you’ll have a team of 3 / 4 / 5 for planets 1 / 2 / 3, with a VIP that you have to protect who joins for the final ship zone. If you’re familiar with the game Chrono Ark (another roguelite), it’s similar in nature to that, where you’ll get your choice from 2 heroes to add to your team that run (or choice of 3 with a certain optional upgrade). Whenever your run ends (whether victorious or defeated), you’ll have the opportunity to spend your two different meta-currencies on various kinds of unlocks.

[h1]Meta Progression[/h1]

Meta progression takes three main forms in this game, and are unlocked using two currencies:
[olist]
[*] Robot upgrades (red currency)

[*] Equipment unlocks (red currency)

[*] Hero unlocks (blue currency)
[/olist]

Like most roguelites, this game does offer difficulty options (I’ve seen only 3 levels), for an increase of challenge for an increase in meta-currency gains. Merely beat the game on a given difficulty to unlock the following one.

The robot upgrades (little flying thing that goes with you everywhere) are a “choice of one” situation with some pretty cool stuff, including things like some free armor repair when camping, more vendor options between planets, and more flexibility in adding heroes during your run (choice of 3 instead of choice of 2).

Equipment unlocks work in a similar fashion to something like Dead Cells, where once you’ve unlocked certain pieces, they’ll potentially show up in future runs.

[u]An important aside about equipment unlocks[/u]: There is one really good and one really annoying aspect to this system:

[u]The Good[/u]: You can choose one piece of equipment to start with on every run. It will just be the level 1 version of it, but, this can help things go a lot smoother from the get-go. I really like this, as it gives you “one more little significant choice on your starting loadout”, especially as the early parts of a run can be a little more difficult before your crew develops that much.

[u]The Annoying[/u]: Unfortunately, Massive Damage didn’t learn the lesson about equipment unlocks that Dead Cells eventually did: you can unlock “subpar equipment” which just dilutes the item pools with stuff which is clearly inferior to others. This therefore incentivizes the player to “skip over” unlocks for pieces of equipment which they deem “not as worth it”. I can feel hopeful that perhaps Massive Damage will reconsider the way that item pools work in a similar fashion to how Dead Cells allowed the player to remove things from the possible item pools. Otherwise, players can end up going “oh no, I’ve made things worse for myself by unlocking X item, and I can’t do anything about it unless I start a fresh file”.

Hero unlocks tie in mainly with the relational system which I made mention of in the camping description. Most heroes will only have relational levels up to tier 3, but some will have up to tier 4. Tier 1 gives a small passive bonus to each hero, tier 2 unlocks their fury combo ability (kind of like a duo-limit break), tier 3 unlocks another small passive bonus, but tier 4 unlocks the ability to purchase “Progeny Heroes”, to give you more options for your crew in the future. Note that the relational system and its bonuses (save for the meta-unlock of progeny) is on a per-run basis, and not permanent.

[u]To clear up one very important aspect about how Progeny Heroes work (minor mechanical spoilers)[/u]:

There are only (number spoiler) [spoiler] 4 [/spoiler] “new heroes” to unlock through this system. All of the other progeny heroes are merely variants of the (number spoiler) [spoiler] 13 [/spoiler] heroes in total. This is not to say that “this sounds lame compared to what the store page made it sound like”, but moreso to temper players’ expectations about the game. These variants on the heroes are actually pretty neat, as they’ll have adjusted base stats and small differences on their active abilities, such as swapping out A ability for B, and/or learning certain abilities at differing levels than their other progeny variants.

The second kind of hero unlock you get are class perks for the various heroes. As you gain the blue currency during your runs, it will go into a meta-counter which you level-up in. When you reach certain thresholds of this, it will unlock a second / third / etc class perk for each hero. This therefore gives you starting loadout options of either “Rookie” (which makes relationships improve faster) / class perk 1 / class perk 2 / etc for your three starting heroes. Along with the various cool bonuses these can offer, it also changes the color scheme on your hero for a nice effect.

[h1]Final Thoughts and Comments[/h1]

For the various flaws that Star Renegades has, I am optimistic that Massive Damage will smoothen things out with post-launch support. They’ve been quite receptive to the playerbase’s bug reports, and have announced plans for more content development.

I love the game’s battle system and how it makes me think a lot with every turn. Every situation I’m faced with is a puzzle on “ok, how am I going to deal with this?” Executing those perfect turns and combos feels satisfying, and when you take casualties, it’s a learning experience on “ahh, yeah, I should watch out for those kinds of issues next time”.

Some may not be too thrilled with how each run takes “so long” (6-8 hrs) for a roguelite, but personally, I’ve been fine with that, as I can comfortably save and exit whenever I need to and continue next time.

I’m not super into story / thematics on games, so my opinion on them on Star Renegades is that it’s not a game you play for the story. I’ve heard both praise and complaints for its non-serious and comedic tone, with plenty of dialogue interactions which honestly don’t make sense. Such things don’t bother me as there’s just “thematic fluff” on the game’s actual mechanics. Basically, the story isn’t something incredibly deep or long to keep you motivated to play -- you’re playing this run after run cause you like the game.",1600125987,1600202719,True,27,0,0.705244660377502441,3,False,False,False,76561198031438656,345,14,2606,393,1526,1614060743,,

One might think that a big RPG fan and someone who enjoys roguelike games will be pleased. Sadly this is not the case. I will now describe how each feature that was supposed to draw me in, but disappointed me deeply instead.

There are two main points that pushed me to get a refund and to write this review.

Building relations between team members - the feature is present. It is however very limited - the dialogues are simplistic, lack depth and are reduced to few, short, bland sentences during camping only. It's definitely not what I expected.

What happens when you die - everything resets. The level you have been progressing through is gone, your levels and items are gone and you start from scratch on a new, randomly generated (i think) level. I died fighting the last boss of the first mission and when I realized that I have to do everything from the start, including social links between party members - I got frustrated because in my opinion such design takes away your immersion and attachment to the characters you are playing ( the story justifies this by ""going to a diffrent reality"").

75874283,english,"Hey, so, I've got many more hours in since my first attempt at a review. Got a much more informed take to share, now.

Star Renegades is the reason why my sleep schedule is ruined, conjuring a mad case of ""one more turn"" syndrome every time I boot it up. It's a complex timeline based RPG battle system on roguelite framework with witty writing, amazing art, and a soundtrack with a great deal of emotional depth. 

It reminds me a LOT of Into the Breach, in a way. I can spend a lot of time looking at a single turn, before dropping some big brain play and coming out feeling like champ. There's also some major story themes they share, and yet Star Renegades still very much comes out as its own game. Either way, an Into the Breach comparison is a HUGE win in my book.

Now, the game may seem frustrating at first, and in all my time playing it I think I've only been absolutely screwed once. But I learned - I know how to make a balanced party, and how to prioritize equipment in each of my runs. Carry on, and you too will learn how mulch imperium soldiers.

75784890,english,"Visually stunning, there's an enemy nemesis system, and a combat system that constantly keeps you trying to maximize your turns. There are a number of mechanics here that are inherently designed to make you become attached to your characters in any given run - something I love in any game. The character variety is honestly more impressive than I expected, and the amount of strategy there is in the campfire system made me incredibly happy (especially after hearing devs mention that it was partially inspired by the Fire Emblem series).

Depending on what your team setup is, you can play it safe by blocking everything, all the time, and slowly chipping down the enemy, or by only using defense when you need to and focusing solely on offense. This isn't to go into how gear can cause some of your characters to become insanely powerful (I once got a gun the let someone destroy end game bosses' armor in one to two attacks), and unlocking new equipment between runs can add some variety to runs.

A few gripes I have are that the characters gain specific abilities at each level, causing your characters' build diversity to be solely relegated to items. This can make some characters actively better for early game than others, as some characters just don't contribute much to the team early in a run. Additionally, despite being able to name your characters, you're never told you can do so - you have to find out yourself by going to the status menu.

Something a bit divisive, but that's worth mentioning; a single run in this game is long - you're not intended to complete a single run in an hour. Assuming you're doing well, a single run could span the better part of a day. Personally, I love this - partially because of the aforementioned character attachment mechanics - but I can understand it being divisive.

75996894,english,"I was really excited to dig into this game - just look at it, it's gorgeous, and I've spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on the Fire Emblem series and games like Slay the Spire. The sci-fi atmosphere and idea of a roguelite RPG with a character relationship system like the Fire Emblem games was super enticing.  Unfortunately, every time Star Renegades has a good idea, it shoots itself in the foot.

This is one of the rare RPGs that would be improved by deleting literally every line of dialogue from the game and simply not having any. Every character has exactly the same personality, except for the personal gimmick they mention - one likes stealing things, one likes hunting things, etc.  There's no more depth to any of them than that, and dialogue repeats so often that you'll already be bored of it by the end of your first run.  Every line of every character is a painfully unfunny quip, like the ""we have food at home"" version of a Joss Whedon flick. Companion systems are fun when you can see each character's personality and how they play off of each other. Hard to do that or want to engage with it when all of your characters are essentially identical.

The deterministic combat is fun, but mechanically bloated and with an unclear UI.  On later planets, enemies often have effects or attacks that don't display on each turn's action meter, and half the time the information you do have is unclear, if not outright wrong. The Empath's ability to give a free action, in particular, is painfully worded.  This combined with the lack of a glossary for icons makes it hard to feel like you have a full grip on exactly what's happening or why a turn will play out that way.  This makes planning your turns a chore, jumping back and forth between characters to see which combination of abilities leads to the apparent best outcome.

Es ist mal wieder soweit, diesmal habe ich für euch Star Renegades dabei. Ich habe schon einige gescheiterte Durchläufe hinter mir, viele Gegner besiegt und gut gelacht. Meine gesammelte Erfahrung und Gedanken, fasse ich hier nun wieder zusammen.


[h1][b]Die Story[/b][/h1]

Das Imperium, angeführt von MUTTER, erobert die gesamte Dimension. Doch es gibt Widerstand! Die Star Renegades – Rebellen, die sich gegen die Herrschaft auflehnen, kämpfen gegen das Imperium an. Doch was passiert, wenn sie den schier endlosen Feind niemals bezwingen? Ist es überhaupt möglich, den Kreislauf zu durchbrechen?


[h1][b]Das Gameplay / Die Spielmechanik[/b][/h1]

Star Renegades vereint Rouge-lite und Strategie in sich und bringt das sehr schön zur Geltung. Habt ihr das Tutorial beendet und den Kampf in der Dimension für immer verloren, werdet ihr automatisch in die nächste Dimension geschickt, um den Kampf gegen das Imperium erneut anzutreten.

Bevor ihr loszieht, erstellt ihr euch ein Team aus verschiedenen Helden, welche die unterschiedlichsten Fähigkeiten mit sich bringen. Diese gilt es zu lernen und geschickt zu kombinieren, damit ihr bestmögliche Ergebnisse erzielen könnt.

Habt ihr euer Team zusammengestellt, werdet ihr auf den ersten Planeten gesandt und kämpft euch Stück für Stück zum Titanenkern, welchen ihr erreichen müsst, bevor der Behemoth es tut. Das Spiel verfügt hier über ein Tag/Nachtsystem, ihr könnt am Tag nur begrenzt Gebiete erkunden und in der Nacht könnt ihr gewonnene Gebiete noch einmal erkunden, möglich das ihr was finden werdet. So stellt ihr euch eure Route zusammen, denn am dritten Tag taucht der Behemoth auf – der „Weltboss“ und versucht den Titanenkern zu erobern. Gelingt ihm dies, ist die Dimension verloren und ihr fangt von vorne an.

Neben dem Behemoth gibt es auch einfache Fußsoldaten und Offiziere. Diese werden im sogenannten Nemesis-System (welches bekannt aus Mittelerde – Schatten des Krieges ist) dargestellt. Hier könnt ihr euch im Vorfeld informieren, gegen welche Offiziere ihr antreten wollt und welche ihr lieber aus dem Weg gehen solltet. Verliert ihr die Partie, können Offiziere im Rang aufsteigen und neue Fähigkeiten erlernen. Besiegt ihr sie, wird ihr Platz von einem neuem Offizier eingenommen.

Und das ist auch wichtig! Für jeden bestrittenen Kampf erhaltet ihr Wissens- und Techpunkte, welche ihr in die nächste Dimension mitnehmt, um euch dort dann neue Helden freizukaufen oder Ausrüstung.

Die Kämpfe in Star Renegades verlaufen rundenbasiert. Doch hier gibt es gleich eine Besonderheit, denn ihr wisst zu jeder Zeit, welche Aktion der Feind gegen euch einsetzt und anhand des Zeitstrahles, der sich im oberen Teil eures Bildschirms befindet, könnt ihr euch eine Strategie ausdenken, wie ihr euren Feinden zuvorkommt. Das Kernelement des Spiels ist, den Feind auszuspielen, sprich ihr habt die Möglichkeit mit euren Angriffen den Gegner zu verlangsamen, sodass dieser in der Runde keine Aktion durchführen kann. Außerdem könnt ihr eine genaue Prognose erstellen, wie die Runde ausgeht. Ihr könnt feststellen, wie viel Schaden ihr am Feind machen werdet und wie viel Schaden ihr diese Runde auch einstecken müsst. Hierbei habt ihr kein Zeitlimit, welches euch dabei unter Druck setzen wird und könnt euch ganz auf eure Strategie konzentrieren.

Am Ende eines Jeden Kampfes erhaltet ihr, neben den beständigen Wissen- und Techpunkten, DNA-Punkte welche ihr einsetzen könnt, um eure Helden dieser Dimension, aufzuleveln. So erhalten sie mehr HP, Stärke und Fähigkeiten, welche ihr auch brauchen werdet. Zusätzlich könnt ihr auch auf Ausrüstung stoßen, welche den jeweiligen Helden zugeordnet werden können, um sie noch stärker zu machen.

Wenn man mit der Umgebung interagiert, wird man schnell feststellen, dass eine Menge Witz in dem Spiel enthalten ist. Es hat an sich eine düstere Thematik, nimmt sich hierbei aber selbst nicht zu ernst.


[h1][b]Die Steuerung[/b][/h1]

Sowohl Maus und Tastatur, als auch der Controller kann genutzt werden. Hier kann auch nicht viel erwähnt werden, da ihr lediglich euch per Mausklick oder Analogstick auf der Karte fortbewegt und sämtliche eingaben über einfache Eingabe stattfinden, ebenso wie im Kampf.


[h1][b]Der Sound[/b][/h1]

Die Soundkulisse von Star Renegades im „Retro-futurismus“ gehalten. Wir sprechen hier von klassischer 16-Bit Hintergrundmusik, die etwas mysteriöses, eben futuristisch an sich hat. Während der Kämpfe wird diese sehr action reich und mit satten Laserfeuer oder Schlägen untermauert. Im großen und ganzen eine sehr schöne Soundkulisse.


[h1][b]Die Grafik[/b][/h1]

Passend zum Sound setzen die Entwickler auf eine Pixel-Grafik. Charaktere, Hintergrund und Feinde sehen wirklich klasse aus und sind perfekt in Szene gesetzt. Animationen machen hier Lust auf mehr. Das Design an sich orientiert sich hier mehr an dem Futurismus der 80er Jahre, als Vergleich habe ich mir hier Generation Zero genommen. Hier kann man ebenfalls erkennen, dass sich der Futurismus aus vergangener Zeit orientiert und nicht den Futurismus der Gegenwart in Anspruch nimmt. Vieles wirkt Futuristisch aber dennoch „alt“. 


[h1][b]Mein Fazit[/b][/h1]

Dieses Spiel war für mich eine gelungene und wirklich schöne Abwechslung. Mir persönlich gefällt es nicht, immer wieder von neuem zu beginnen. Dafür hat man ja zum Glück Rouge-lite erfunden. Was mich hier aber überzeugt hat ist ganz klar das Kampfsystem, welches mir in der Form noch nicht über den Weg gelaufen ist. Außerdem ist dieses Spiel so konzipiert, dass es einen sehr hohen Wiederspielwert hat, welches nicht nur dem Rouge-lite Element geschuldet ist.

Daher kann ich dieses Spiel uneingeschränkt an Rouge-LIKE/LITE Veteranen und Neueinsteigern gleichermaßen Empfehlen. Wer ein Spiel mit hohem Wiederspielwert sucht, ist hier ebenfalls richtig.

75814415,english,"A roguelite JRPG.

It's basically like Into the Breach but instead of SRPG combat it has JRPG combat.  The fun of the game is 'breaking' the enemies on the stagger bar, making them inactive for the turn and letting your teammates get critical hits on them.  It ramps up in complexity throughout each run, adding more moves, more characters, and more enemies up through the end of each run.

Each run you earn intel, science, and experience points that go towards progress between runs.  They let you unlock new characters, items, and other perks.

I thought the game would have more plot to unlock in the metagame, but it seems incredibly sparse in that regard.  I've only done 4 or 5 runs and I have seen a lot of repeated dialogue, which is disappointing.  When thinking about the artistry in the game, the writing is the weakest part by far for me.  The graphics and the music are amazing, the writing wasn't even interesting the first time I saw it, much less the 2nd or the 10th.

Overall, I'm a bit disappointed in the roguelite aspects of this game.  But it is literally the most beautiful pixel art game in my opinion, and the combat is fun, so I think it is a good game.

Abbreviated Review: https://youtu.be/h-BhkF2sP18
 
[h1]Bar Fights[/h1]
The deepest and most compelling element of Star Renegades is its combat system. On the surface, it’s relatively simple, but whether or not you progress through the game depends on your understanding of it. The basis is an active battle system where every event is placed on a bar at the top of the screen. At the beginning of every round, you see what the enemy is going to do based on this. Their attacks (or other actions) will show up as icons and you’ll even see who they’re attacking. Your goal is to react to this in the best possible way to deal the most damage while taking the least.
 
The way this works is that many attacks can push those enemy attacks further down the initiative bar. If they get pushed far enough, they fall off the end and a “break” occurs. This means the attack doesn’t happen that round. Most of the character actions don’t have any sort of resource (AP or MP) required to use, but you only get one per round. They do varying amounts of damage and sometimes have other status effects involved, but each takes a certain amount of time on the initiative bar. If they happen before an enemy attack, they “crit” and get more effects and damage.
 
Enemies can’t be delayed forever though, they have a listed number of attacks that will push them back before the attack lands. Even if it breaks, the attack may happen in the next round once you’ve exhausted all of those pushes. This whole system builds upon itself until it ends up being rich with tactical and strategic moves for every battle. That’s a good thing too because there’s not much else going on in the game.
 
[h1]The Rest of the Universe[/h1]
Star Renegades has a strange story about interdimensional raiders that come to attack your planet. The premise is explained loosely in some dialogue as you move into the game, but even after finishing it I just barely know what is going on. However, this falls in line with just about any roguelite game since a heavy story would viciously bog down the times you have to restart the game. That can be its own issue though.
 
The vast majority of your outside time will be spent trying to pick a route on the map overworld that will net you the most resources in the number of moves you have. Each of the three main planets you travel to has a map split into sections, most of which have an enemy to fight. You have three days to do as much of this as you can and each day you have three moves you can make on the map. Some zones will lock making them inaccessible, so you have to plan to get what you want. The zones, in addition to fights, may have crates with loot or money as well as other buffs. Once those three days are up, it’s on to the boss battle.
 
Between each of the days, you camp and use cards that have (mostly) temporary effects to buff up your team for the upcoming day. These can also be used to heal the persistent health damage you take from hits that happen when the shields of your characters go down. The cards also have the effect of improving a relationship meter between the characters that use them. This will give them bonus stats, special combo attacks, and can even get them to have “progeny” that turn into new classes.
 
[h1]Everything is a Roguelite[/h1]
Within the narrative, Star Renegades works as a roguelite. Every time you lose, your little robot guide warps to a new dimension and you start over. Each time, you gain resources like “intel” that let you unlock more classes and item types to use each run. It works reasonably well, but at the same time, it can really suck. I was four hours into my first run when I lost the first time. That happened twice. The final run took upwards of seven and the final boss was nearly an hour of that. Losing can be devastating. If it worked like Crying Suns where every chapter is a save point, it would be more forgiving. Failing at that final fight may have had me stepping away from the game for a while.
 
Star Renegades does many things right though. The animation style of the pixel art graphics is awesome. I loved watching the attacks, at least until I had seen them all dozens of times. That’s kind of the detraction of a roguelite. However, it does provide a fast forward function that lets you zip through all of those animations. This allows you to enjoy this great design exactly as much as you want to.
 
Aside from the screen being a little cluttered when several units are on the field and some places where there could probably be more detail, there aren’t too many additional notable issues with Star Renegades. The game is fun to play for me as I like the technical combat of something like a classic JRPG but don’t necessarily need a whole novel-worth of narrative to enjoy it. I think most of my issues are fixable, but even with them, I’d still recommend this for fans of rich combat-heavy RPGs.

75969896,english,"1) An option to turn on world-save states (so that a wipe just resets your run to the beginning of the world) is necessary. In fact, make that the default and add an Ironman toggle to make squad wipes reset the run/campaign (e.g. bad guys win all universes and the save file gets bricked), and maybe a bronze man to perform the default behavior now when wiping. I'm no stranger to strategy games, and it took me 3 runs (18+ hours) to beat the final boss the first time. Each defeat also felt very unfair since a lot of the game is explicitly telling you what's happening, but, because a few things aren't clear, a single boss mechanic can wipe 4-8 hours down the drain and then it's back to the grind of borderline boring enemies to get back to the interesting boss part. 


2) I haven't heard anyone else mention this yet, but there's a very large spike in difficulty at the second boss. It's so big, that I went from almost being bored on the regular enemies in the second world to full on wtfomgbbq when I faced Big Bertha. In fact, overall, I think the generic enemies are a bit too easy, at least with the starting team, until maybe the third world, and the second boss is too hard. The anti-stun mechanic is super punishing, and there no way to know what ""Rabid"" means, even after proc'ing it since she already does 2x actions on her turn.


Overall great game, but the ""pacing"" of the difficulty could use some work, or maybe just make there be an ""easy"" mode too so people can see the story their first time through. Adding default save states and bronze/Ironman toggles would also be great additions along with achievements or some other reward to compel those of us who just love the challenge.",1600105722,1600105722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198023039376,80,2,5600,0,1620,1612673891,,

This game is very difficult, even on it's lowest difficulty setting. One miscalculation may cost you the life of a character, which may or may not result in a domino effect that wipes out your entire party. But that is okay, becasue you can come back with better equipment, better knowledge of the mechanics and bigger guns... or an entirely different team composition alltogether.

It is entirely possible to defeat the imperium on your first run however. The Saboteur has one of the best Staggers in the entire game and the large delay on your Archon's one ""healing"" ability (Shield Recharge) means he can recharge an ally (mostly your dedicated tank/DD, the Valkyre) and keep her going. Yes, the first Behemoth is intimidating, scary and, at times, appears to be entirely unfair, but the fight is far from impossible. If in doubt, defend. ;)

If one of your characters falls in battle, don'T worry, they get revived after you came out victorious... with 1 hp and an injury you can only get rid of with an imperium sanctioned first aid kit.

The interactions between characters is mostly flavor text, at times downright maddening, but none the less entertaining. Now excuse me as I sign up for #SaveThePsiBuffalos.

This is a Roguelike Strategy Game. You can't keep on smashing A and assume you will waltz through the opposition unopposed. That being said, there are some hilariously overpowered things you can do with the right equipment and the right characters. I myself am particularly fond of The Marksman and The Empath - sniping Twice in one turn is hilariously effective. :D

75910452,english,"First off, I wanna preface this as a soft recommendation. While I’ve been enjoying myself, I was hoping for a game I could really sink some time into, but as it stands, I can see myself dipping out after a few more runs.

The core battle mechanics are initially engaging, but could use some balancing and refinement. The deterministic nature of the combat makes finding ways to initiate interrupts and counters quite easy. I soon found myself just going through the motions for the majority of enemy encounters. I was hoping this would be a game that would make all my victories feel well earned, but (especially with tanky bosses) it just feels like an endless series of repeating the correct inputs over and over. More like facing battles of attrition, rather than truly tactical victories. That said, the core battle mechanics are enjoyable, they just don’t push my brain in the way I was hoping for. 

The roguelike elements kinda fall flat for me. The only decision that has felt to have any consequence for me has been party composition. Item and weapon selection and my routes through the level haven’t really seemed to prevent me from completing a run, as long as my squad selection is balanced enough. I wish my choices felt like they mattered more.
 
The pixel art is top notch and might honestly be worth the price of admission for some players. Absolutely love em. The soundtrack, while fitting, is honestly forgettable, and I soon turned it off. The writing is super cringey with a bunch of jokes where you can tell even the writers know its not funny. Halfway through my first run I just started skipping all dialogue. 

I know I’m sounding whiny, but I guess that is because this game is close to being something I could love. I really enjoy the deterministic nature of the JRPG combat, and hopefully the devs spice things up a bit with future updates. As of right now, increased difficulty options just seem to make enemies more tanky. Not a satisfying option for me. 

I guess I’d recommend this to players who enjoy JRPG style combat but are looking for something a little headier.

75946539,english,"Really am having a lot of fun with this game so far and one hundred percent recommend it to anyone who enjoys games like The Darkest Dungeon or Slay the Spire.

Gameplay: Combat is a turn based system on a psuedo timescale, with different actions placing characters in different positions on the timescale. Your and your enemies actions get a guaranteed crit if they hit a character that hasn't attacked yet. Throw in a diverse enough enemy pool each with their own ability pool and each turn feels like a puzzle and you wont be just making the same turn over and over again. It's honestly one of the best turn based combat systems I've seen that doesn't use cards to force RNG making your turns not repetitive. My biggest complaint is that a single run takes me on average about 3 hours, and a lot of that time is spent watching animations I've seen hundreds of times by this point. There's a speed up combat option but it has this terrible fast-forward animation it places over everything which is not what I want. I just want the animations to go faster.

Graphics: The game has a pixel style and it's done really well. The overworlds are decent enough if a little boring and static. The in-combat stages are absolutely beautiful though and the devs did a great job making a 2.5D battle field. Combat animations are also big and varied and flashy. 

Character Design: It's okay. Most of the characters have a fairly generic look to them, and the enemies aren't all that inspired either. Bosses likewise are also pretty boring save for one that I really really like. 

Writing: This is easily the weakest part of the game. All of the characters I've seen so far, not having unlocked all of them, are basically just one note quirks. Enemies are basically just a list of phrases without any personality. This is fine to a degree as the fun of this genre of game mostly comes from the gameplay loop, however the devs made the decision to make the characters have personal moments with each other and to make comments on enemies and the environment while on the overmap. So they put in the effort to create systems where their characters can have personality, and then failed to deliver on the premise. It's too bad because the core systems they implemented are pretty good, the writing just doesn't live up to it.

Music: It's not bad or annoying, but neither is it memorable in any way. Having played this game for 36 hours at time of writing I honestly cannot remember a single song or note or tune at time of writing. That's not a good thing, but it's also not bad. 

Sound Effects: These are pretty decent, enemies and allies attacks are all varied and have different sounds you'd associate to their actions and it mostly lives up to it. 

Final Thoughts: The core gameplay of this game is great. The devs did an amazing job of looking at the systems of the turn based rogue-lite genre and implementing one of the best versions of it I've seen yet.

[h1]一句话总结：精美的像素画面，有趣的战斗系统，复杂的roguelike模式，以及故弄玄虚的游戏剧情[/h1]

《星际反叛军（star renegades）》是一款近期少见的精美像素游戏，而且是个欧美模仿日本风格的像素游戏。

所以看起来有点美式，也有点日式。

这说明了啥，说明这个制作组做不够宅，你看看制作《赛博朋克小酒馆（ VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action）》的委内瑞拉死宅，你说他们画的不像日式风格？

你说《心跳俱乐部》一个美国制作组，愣是做出来了日式Galgame的感觉。

画风的风格上，也体现出来整个游戏的质量，有精妙的地方，让你觉得哎呀这个游戏不错哟，也有玩起来十分疲劳的地方，让你觉得这个游戏简直了，做了个嘛呢。、

[h1]敌未出手我已下手[/h1]

整个游戏根据是根据行动条来进行攻击顺序的。

这个不是核心，核心的是，每个敌人都有一个被攻击后，可延迟行动顺序的特性。

也就是说原本我方A的行动顺序慢与敌方C，但是我方B的行动顺序最高，在攻击敌方C的时候，有可能把敌方C的攻击顺序延后。

也就变成了原本的攻击顺序是B、C、A。

在B攻击以后会变成B、A、C。

敌方C攻击前只挨揍一次，变成了挨揍两次。

延迟攻击的本身就代表了C很有可能在A攻击后死亡。

制作组便是完全以这个核心点为中心来进行扩展。

所以不论是我方的攻击还是敌方的攻击都有两个层级，一个是非暴击，另一个就是必然暴击。

暴击与否的条件不是随机的，而是固定的，就是你的攻击顺序在敌人之前，你就一定暴击。

能够防止敌人攻击的手段，一共有三个，一个是你杀死敌人，一个是通过普通攻击把敌人打出这一回合的行动条，最后一个就是某些角色特有的只能每一局使用一次地直接阻止敌人行动的技能。

而我们每一局的胜利方式就是杀死敌人。

因此我们就看出了这个游戏每一局战斗的核心了，敌未出手我已下手。

这个游戏表面上是个回合制游戏，实际上更接近于策略类游戏，所以每一局的开始我们都是可以观察敌人的弱点是什么，以方便我们进行攻击。

甚至每个攻击都带上所谓的普通、轻型、重击等特性。

如何利用游戏里的攻击机制迅速杀死敌人是这个游戏要考虑的事情，而回合制的游戏，一般都是你打一下我打一下，而这个游戏之所以归于策略类是因为，每一局的开始我们就已经给每个人规划好行动的方式了，并且在中途无法改变。

是的，这个游戏没有后悔，退一步的功能。

[h1]roguelike的失败是因为内容的不足[/h1]

整个游戏一共分为四个大地图，每个大地图你都可以看到固定的小怪以及精英怪。

大地图的生成是随机的，也就是说你每一次进来看到的地图样式是发生变化的，每一张地图基本上也就有两条路线可以供你选择，为我们选择路线要考虑的基本上有两点，一点是这条路上的敌人是谁？打赢这个区域里的道具是什么。

不论敌人还是道具甚至整个大地图都是可以明明白白看见的，所以在强调一遍，这是个策略游戏，它的目的是让你思考在如今的环境里如何获得胜利，而不是让玩家踩暗雷，然后一脸懵逼。

roguelike的目的之一是通过玩家的反复尝试而提高玩家对着有游戏的理解能力，也就是说，死亡是roguelike的必然阶段。

这个游戏也同样如此，在没有熟练掌握对应的规则前，死亡也同样是常态。

但这个行为是有前提条件的，就是你不能让玩家的死亡代价太大，究竟什么样子才能叫做大什么才能叫做不大？

这是一个主观判断，但我们可以用经典的roguelike例子来进行比较，比如《以撒》，他的死亡代价是装备全无，玩家得到的提升是对上一句的敌人、房间、道具的理解，下一局开始的准备为无。可以直接开始，没有什么要准备的，这就是在间接地减少了死亡代价。

而这个游戏，我们可以来看一下，死亡后，毫无疑问除了主角本身外，其他人包含道具、装备全部清空。但是通用数据是保留下来的。你可以通过通用数据来提升自己。这看起来是个很棒的注意，似乎减少了死亡的代价。但在游戏里却是一个很蠢的行为。

因为如果这些通用数据产生的效果很重要，那么也就代表你通过里它的占比很重，你的死亡概率会被大大提升。

如果这些通用数据产生的效果不重要，那么他们存在的意义就不需要有了。

这是在游戏设计里很常见的一个悖论，你不能因为你想加什么就去加什么，如果这个数据重要，那它就得是游戏机制，如果它不重要，那么它就不应该存在。

这个游戏也便是验证了这个话的正确性。

这个数据的存在不仅让玩家的基数数值的有意减少，从而提升死亡概率，同样的还让玩家从一个单纯比拼脑力的策略游戏，变成了一个为了能力的提升而必须进行地刷刷刷行为了。

roguelike的产生也便是如此。

这款游戏地体量与售价决定了，他不能让玩家在2个小时里通关，他必须要降低基础属性，让玩家既要拼脑力也要拼运气与刷数据，以延长游戏的通关时间。

[h1]道具、装备、英雄与感情[/h1]

游戏里剩下来没有说的就是其他的点缀了，这些点缀同时服务于单局的战斗机制与全局的roguelike。

单局的战斗机制很好理解嘛，就是想方设法地提供单局游戏里胜利的概率，这些概率是强力的道具装备，是高等级的英雄，是通过感情高后产生的合体技与属性地提升。

全局的roguelike也好理解，就是道具与装备永远是多选一，英雄永远是可以多种组合，玩家需要长期的游玩才能判断出来哪种英雄合适，而英雄的等级产生的招式决定了，你想要吃透一个英雄至少要给他升级到8,9级，在这个10级满级的游戏里，这个行为的代价很高。

自然感情地建立与生成的连招也必须通过长久时间地试错后，才能明白这个技能地实际效果如何，更何况制作组还挖了一个大坑，成为灵魂伴侣的两位英雄可以产下子嗣。

这又再一次地加大了英雄池的大坑。

[h1]最后[/h1]

这款游戏战斗时的画面、运镜、特效，在今年的像素类游戏里是十分出彩的。

游戏的核心机制也就是通过各种手段阻挡敌人出招，以让玩家通过自己的聪明才智单方面地蹂躏敌人为快感。

但由于整个游戏的内容不足，不仅仅是地图少、流程短并且敌人的种类也少。

为了解决这个问题，制作组加入了roguelike的机制，不论这个机制是制作组最早就已经确定必须加入的还是之后才决定加入的。

roguelike的存在引发了游戏的一些恶果。

把本应该属于玩家的基础数值，拿走一部分让给了角色死亡后的roguelike机制，玩家死亡与试错的成本太大，这对roguelike的核心——快入让我证明我能行，逐渐慢出依旧是证明我能行，产生了矛盾。

所以roguelike不适合有数值的游戏，尤其是数值的提升不仅仅咋roguelike的对局里产生，在对局外还产生的而游戏。

它更适合动作类，快速简答，并且所有的内容都在每一局的开始，以让玩家觉得，我不行，是我的问题，而不是你游戏机制的问题。

玩家基本上只要死一次，第一个地图打完了，这个游戏的内容也就体验的差不多了，后面的3个大地图，只不过让你重复体验游戏的内容而已。

75934779,english,"Star Renegades is a fun way to kill an afternoon or five. If you liked games like For The King or Dead Space Derelicts, this game has a very similar feel with a cyber-futuristic style. I hesitate to call it 'cyberpunk' but it draws heavily on that neon palette.

The Pros:
+ Fantastic art, character, and graphic design
+ Thematic abilities and animations
+ Indie roguelike with decent difficulty curve
+ Just enough story to be interesting

Although some might say that the characters are deviantArt tier OCs, nonetheless the various renegades and other pixel sprites are very well done and animated, and scratch that ever harder to reach nostalgia itch. Likewise the interface, outside of the tooltips (covered below), is crisp and neat. The game plays well, remains stable, and hasn't caused me any issues performance-wise outside of a single hiccup that was caused by me launching something else in the background. The difficulty spikes a tiny bit on the second planet if you're not ready for it, but given that you are meant to play and fail multiple playthroughs, I've not really felt frustrated at any point. The carry-over upgrades from one run to the next are helpful without trivializing encounters. 

The Neutrals:
> Pleasant but limited soundtrack
> Planet landscapes are vivid and pretty but likewise repetitive
> Unique dynamic initiative system 

I really like the music, what few tracks of it there are, and the battle themes especially are hard to get tired of. That being said both it and the environments start to get repetitive which isn't the best if you are expected to be replaying it over and over. The dynamic initiative system is nifty, but honestly after a little bit of experimentation with it, I can say that its both a blessing and a curse. It can allow you to set up absolutely devastating alpha hits on dangerous enemies, but against bosses with a lot of hp it ends up just delaying the inevitable. All enemies have a break limit past which they can't be pushed on the meter without having time to recover a bit, and this can really bite you in the ass as all of a sudden they drop their delayed AOE nuke before half your team has acted that round. Unless you can guarantee a kill, 'breaking' an enemy is actually a trap.

The Cons:
- Numerous spelling errors
- Faulty pathing on 'world' map
- Minimal story transitions and tutorial
- Tooltips are sometimes obtuse
- Some party compositions are vastly, vastly superior to others. Questionable balancing in places.
- Woke-lite

The game could really have used one more final pass from a competent editor - there are numerous instances of missing punctuation and misspelled words. After the initial introduction to the basic mechanics the game really doesn't explain what all the various status effects do, or even really how the initiative 'Break' system actually functions. Once you do understand though, some fights become absolutely trivial with the correct setup, well into the 'endgame'. Faulty pathing can cause your party to get stuck behind terrain and background clutter often enough to be annoying. 

Another strike against the game is the creators' weird hateboner against the Branch Davidians, there's at least two negative references to them specifically, amidst the dialogue that is constantly inserting jokes at the expense of conspiracy theorists already. Its amusing at first but its done to death, showing up in nearly every interaction, and you start to get the feeling that there's a hidden vendetta there. It's like if you made a stand-up comedy routine but every single joke for an hour straight was about Mormons. It wears out its welcome.

--------

Don't take the extra words in the con section get you down - overall this is a fun game and I can see myself playing for at least another 40-50 hours, which is, in my opinion, worth the price tag.

75924707,schinese,"        把三个模式打通了，得出的结论就是粗嚼的话这个游戏差不多25小时内容到头了，细品可能能玩久一点大概40-50小时，内容不算很耐玩重复度过高。整个游戏的随机要素还算比较多，招人和装备的随机影响都很大，但是实在是装备的选择空间太小，没有用的属性实在是太多，导致很难让人产生反复游玩的兴趣。
        画面非常的好看且耐看，是非常精致的像素画，而且可以说工作量是非常的巨大了，每个场景都极具特色，而且场景类型到色调都很多样且搭配合理。
        但是移动的ui做的很奇怪，很多地形的移动位置实在是过于不明显，自动寻路攻能也没有做好，只能走直线，遇到障碍物会怼墙鬼畜，我在游戏的第三个星球出现的工厂特殊副本出现了极为严重的卡顿掉帧情况，但是里面的战斗和出地图后的游戏没有问题，疑似优化存在比较大的瑕疵。
        解锁系统非常非常非常肝简直肝的就离谱，作为一个流程很长的游戏这个内容这么肝太夸张了，而且各个能力给的也非常莫名其妙的弱，初始的机器人能力就非常完美且强大，但是问题是这些技能在第二个星球时候收益实在是过第了，比1，3星球的收益低得多。
        这游戏的扎营技能的数值做的非常奇怪，我可以说具有实用价值的2消耗以上的扎营就只有全体加护盾上限天赋的 扎营，其他的从效果到好感收益都远远低于1消耗扎营，甚至还有一个角色的1消耗扎营能给所有人无条件+4好感度，这就特别的过分，2，3消耗群体buff很多都只+2的。
        游戏的数值太不完善导致致战略模式比较单一，推人角色和装备实在是强的过分，但是boss的抗性成长又远远跟不上装备强度提升的程度，甚至在中期就能出现把boss推到直接跳过一个回合没有行动的情况，至少应该加入多次击退增加抗性的机制，而且所有抗性类物品的数值需要极大幅度提升，本身这游戏每人三个装备栏就非常难叠甲抗性，但是装备给的抗性数值实在是低的离谱。
        角色有些前期弱的太离谱只能等后期招点名批评灵能兵，问题在于即使是在后期灵能兵也只是到达了平均水准但是没有特别强，反而是另一个群体辅助角色从开始强势到结尾，甚至省钱一点可以点到5级就能使用，群体击退还能吃满额的击退加成实在是过于过分了，带守护的护盾兵就更离谱了，可怜的抗伤工具人甚至都不配拥有大招，很多角色的很多技能也非常的意义不明，各种技能之间的强度差距大到从功能性到实用性被完爆，大量技能从来都没用过，大招的消耗也很离谱，很多角色大招强度不算很高却有着极高的消耗，一些很实用的技能缺消耗很低，比如20消耗的硬控打断就非常厉害，而有单体加盾的辅助的给一个队友无视距离打人的技能缺消耗也是20就很迷惑，而且具有能够自由行动的技能的角色在瞬发技能之后就不能在提供技能了，应该再设立一个回合结束按钮，至少应该在回合结束之前还能使用。

The only ""bugs"" I've encountered so far are pathing related issues, where you have to tell the party to move around an obstacle instead of them doing it automatically.

75917302,english,"About 24 hours pumped into the game at the time of writing, and one successful completion later I've got mixed feelings.

I think for the price the game is worth it. I recently bought a second copy for a friend, because I genuinely enjoy it, but there are times where the roguelite format can be a bit hard to stomach.

Pro:
+Love the visual style and animations
+I enjoy the combat system, and planning out turns to disrupt and kill as efficiently as possible.
+Heroes are pretty unique in their styles, and the progeny system expands on that allowing you to recruit variations of your favorites with slightly different stats and abilities.

Cons:
-For a roguelite the runs can be LONG. Easily can have a couple hour sunk into a single run, and getting into a deep run is about the only way to get any sort of meaningful progression in terms of currency accumulated.
-A lack of meaningful upgrades. There's a lot to unpack here, and I think this is the core reason the long runs feels like such an issue. As with other roguelites you're meant to fail, purchase upgrades to get stronger, and repeat. However, the upgrades don't really feel like they have a huge impact on your game. These lackluster upgrades are also pricey. The first costs 100 Tech for restore 50% armor at camp, then 200 for more merchants, then 300 an extra mercenary selection per planet. You can score a hundred tech in a run if you make it at least part way through planet 3 taking as many combat paths as you can, but getting this far is probably about a couple hours wort of play. So for an upgrade, you've got to get at least two hours in. Not that big of a deal, I have flown through my runs, okay.. But these upgrades can only have one activated at a time and so far it's been hard for me to replace justifying replacing the initial free perk. Feels bad. You can also use tech to unlock items, awesome. Except these items only drop into the pool of possible loot, and depending on your comp is not always useful. This has left me ignoring most of these unlocks and only targeting specific items for the comps I like to use the most in hopes that it pops up during a run and to not dilute the pool too much. Finally you can use Intel to unlock new heroes, which is fine. You'll probably have an abundance of Intel as unlocking heroes can take a while, and is done by raising relationships at camp with the cards, which brings us to.
-Camp. I don't like having the relationship stuff tied to the buffs from cards. Later runs, once you have everything unlocked (50 hours later), you can be a bit more selective, but it takes a LOT of cards to get to the max 4 heart ranking and I don't even bother looking at the buffs when assigning them. I just dump the largest hearts into characters, which is a shame because they're rarely synergistic with the mercenary you're raising the relationship with, but if you don't then you may not complete the relationship by the time the run ends and you'll have unlocked nothing. In fact, in runs where I prioritize unlocks, I focus on alternating the heroes I need to dump points into since every other level is a card unlock to maximize the amount of options I have to swap cards between them.
-Planet 3. There seems to be a crazy spike in difficulty with this planet. The RNG is at its worst here. If you get stuck on a map boxed in by several large threats, and those threats all drop AoEs at the start of the fight or back to back your run is done, almost guaranteed. This happens frequently. Because you can't reach the backline without specific mercenaries, abilities, or usually items you often can't disrupt a key target behind a bulky front line or kill the front line fast enough. When you start a planet you have no Fury, so you can't use a big combo ability to clear anything quickly. There is no good AoE regeneration present. The Empath barely regens shields by that point in the game, and the main shield support is single target. If you get a bad planet 3 start, there's not much you can do as enemy AoE attacks seem disproportionately brutal compared to nearly anything else if they have shield bypass it's even worse as there's not good way to regen health outside select mercenaries at camp, and if you can reach the first aid box. Because you really don't get meaningful resources unless you clear at least a good portion of planet 3, and you've got a good bit of time invested in the run by this point it stings. By contrast I find if you can make it to the ship, that it's the easiest run up to the final boss.
-Finally, very minor thing, the game page and achievements seem to be a bit buggy. Stuff doesn't want to pull up, or seem to respond. I have 5 of the progeny unlocked, and I don't have the achievement for first progeny? I don't really track those, so it's not a big deal, but something to be aware of.

I know my cons section is huge, but I just wanted to expand on why I find these systems frustrating. They haven't prevented me from enjoying the game, and dumping time into it, but I do hope to see some of these things addressed going forward because I think for a roguelite that involves such a heavy time commitment per run the issues are more glaring and can definitely push people away.

As a big fan of Massive Damage's Halcyon, I have been waiting eagerly for their next title and at last it is here and it does not disappoint!

Massive Damage stayed true to what made their games unique in this game:
1. Retro techno music that immediately connects you with Halcyon.
2. Pixel art mastery.
3. Squad combo combat
4. 80s style humor

These are the things that made Halcyon unique for me and I am glad they are here in Renegades as well!

1. Graphics. The camera dynamically focusing in and out of the action made the action far more immersive.
2. JRPG / battle chaser style combos.

75911043,english,"Well, I may have just found a new obsession. In short, this game has one of the most tactical turn based battle systems I remember playing in recent memory, rewarding careful planning and good understanding of a huge toolkit of skills instead of just attacking hard and fast every round. If that sounds intriguing, pick it up. The game is not perfect, but the flaws don't hurt the main experience too much. Here is a full breakdown:

Pros:
- As I said, the battle system is fantastic. I won't explain how it works (check online for that), but I will say the battles and overall gameplay are quite similar to Darkest Dungeon.
- The different classes open up a wealth of strategic options, and each one feels incredibly distinct with what kind of niche they can excel in.
- Similar to Darkest Dungeon, this game puts up a meaty challenge. However, I found Darkest Dungeon felt like its difficulty came from steadily grinding the party down in a slow war of attrition, where as Star Renegades's difficulty comes from understanding the nuances of its complex battle system, and rewards you appropriately for doing so. The challenge to reward ratio feels very good.
- Animation and sound design are exquisite, and are a big part of why the battles are so fun. Even outside of fights, the sound, art and effects contribute a great deal to the experience.
- The characters all have nice designs and distinct personalities (if only they were written better).

Cons:
- The writing isn't bad, but it feels like almost every line of dialogue is trying to be funny or quirky. You know how the Marvel movies will have characters regularly spewing quipy one-liners? This feels like that with no other dialogue to support it. Some succeed, some don't, but it's such a constant stream of jokes on an otherwise serious backdrop that it gives the game a very flimsy tone. Luckily, the story isn't intrusive, so it can be ignored easily. It's a shame though, because the character concepts themselves are quite good.
- There is definitely repetition in the level design. You won't encounter much more than non-random encounters, finding loot, or the occasional random event or side dungeon. I understand that the combat is the core of the gameplay, and the semi-open world map is limited from a gameplay perspective, but I don't see why this game couldn't have added FTL-style dialogue windows to describe non-combat encounters. It would have helped mix up exploration more and given another avenue for world building.

75759607,english,"I usually write a lengthy pros/cons list for reviews.  But I'll get straight to the biggest point, since I have not seen anyone mention this.  THE GAME IS FUNNY.  The dialog and one-liners are real funny.  A mix of satire, camp, and absurdity, all somewhat subtle.  While also still being serious and dramatic.  

Anyway, yeah, as others have said, it's got Fire Emblem style relationships, turn-based JRPGs combat (unique in its own way, but has some of the timing elements of FFX and Radiant Historia), Middle-earth: Shadow series Nemesis style system, typical roguelike/lite dungeon pathing/rewards, etc.

Ahh, what the hay, I'll still do pros/cons w/ what little I've played.  

Pros 
- Great visuals, solid music, very funny.
- You can actually become attached to characters.  [spoiler]They are permanent/named/scripted.  But they do reset levels, gear, etc after each wipe.  This is nice if you don't like the anonymous or new-to-party characters of other party-based roguelikes/lites.  Keep in mind, some characters gained mid-run aren't permanent.[/spoiler]
- Combat requires attention and planning to optimize results.  But still simple enough to sort of cruise control through trash encounters.

Cons
- UI can be a bit...overwhelming or abstruse?  Some concepts and iconography may need extra reviews of the tutorials to fully grasp or understand. 
- A lot of the midway stops in your ""dungeon"" path don't give any rewards.  Perhaps they're there to just worldbuild w/ minor lore bits?
- It may take some time to [spoiler]unlock all the characters/classes.  So don't be too eager to play a specific character early on.  Some classes are progeny-only.  Some you meet mid-run and they join you, but don't count as unlocked.[/spoiler]

I've been excited for this game for over a year and it has not disappointed so far.  It's much more rogue-y than I expected, but nothing too offputting as of yet.

 - Combat is deep and strategic without being overly complicated

 - Plenty of content to unlock and discover for the price point
 - Unbelievably addictive!

Mixed:
 - Story is a bit light weight and surface level. Locations and names are thrown around without much explanation
 - Characters aren't deep but are still fun
 - Nemesis system is a fun inclusion but also bare-bones. Very little variety in nemesis dialogue leads to repeated lines quite early on
 - Late game battle becomes a chaotic mess but still a fun time

Bad:
 - Relationship system is probably the most lightweight in any game I've seen. Needs more dialogue to make it even remotely investing. Companion cards are unbalanced so you always make the same friendships each time
 - Map lockouts are annoying & make trying to navigate the map frustrating at times. Why can't I walk backwards in some sections?

Start Renegades pulls together the best elements of other combat-focused, rogue-lite experiences into one satisfying package. Though lite on any meaningful story or character elements, its filled to the brim with style, personality and combat that keeps you hooked.

75890121,english,"[h1] Belongs in a Museum, not in Your Library [/h1]

Let me start by saying that I really wanted to like this game. It has a lot of great things going for it - gorgeous art, interesting game mechanic, cool cyberpunky setting - but all of those can only do so much against the overwhelming blandness of the core gameplay loop, and just how abysmal the QoL and all the attempted world building is.

The combat sounds really cool on paper, and is why I bought the game. Star Renegades borrows a bit from the Grandia series, so when you're in combat and you attack an enemy, they get bumped down the combat order and can even have their turn removed. This is great! It should make a lot of choices between damage and utility more interesting. Except that you have a very limited number of possible attacks and attack types which ends up meaning that every interaction with enemies feels the same. Your one guy that can delay them the most does the skill he has that's best at delaying, then your guy who is the best at killing uses the highest damage skill. Rinse and repeat for the next enemy, next battle, next campaign. Pretty quickly, it's just boring.

How atrocious everything outside of the combat is doesn't help much. Starting with everything surrounding combat. There are a lot of modifiers in the game that you get from equipment, but there aren't any tool tips. So if you're choosing between ionized, antimatter, nitro, and corrupted, good luck picking the correct one! The bosses have all of their strengths and weaknesses randomized which sometimes just makes them a pain to kill, but really just makes them all feel the exact same. And you don't have enough tools in your belt to make meaningful choices or changeups in a boss fight. That boss has extra defense against heavy attacks and your main damage dealer primarily does heavy damage? You're in for a long one, and there's really not much you can do about it. Lastly on gameplay, for some reason you can't see your heroes skill tree during a campaign, or even what they get next level unless you have enough xp to level them up. So you can't even make choices to round out your squads needs unless you've already played that hero before and remember what powers they get when.

Finally, world building. The writing is awful. Like, they could have had someone do it pro bono and it would have better. On top of that, which characters have their portrait pop up in the dialog box is also procedurally generated, so you have your squad completely breaking character some lines, or my favorite, having arguments with themselves over a couple dialog boxes when they were really good at rolling the conversation dice. And, more personal taste, but the chiptunes sound really flat to me. Again, it feels like they could have licensed better off Newgrounds.

This is all a real shame, because I WANT to like this game. It's gorgeous. Just the art alone almost carries the whole world. If they went back through right now reusing all the assets and made a new game, but this time hired a good writer, gave me even a two branch skill tree for each character, tweaked combat a little to make it more interactive, I'd pay $40 and feel like it was totally worth it.

75879982,english,"I've enjoyed bits of this game, but there's little content and it's both buggy and unpolished. Star Renegades could be good with extensive post-release support, so my review is closer to ""maybe later"" than ""not recommended"". It needs some significant patching and content expansion though.

Whilst this game has a ton of potential, it feels like a rough early access release at the moment. I've done about 7 runs of the game now: 3 complete runs on normal, 1 or 2 complete runs on hard, and 2 unfinished runs on very hard. The store page claims each run is unique, but sadly this isn't true. I kept playing to see if I was unlucky with the algorithm, but it's the exact same enemies and maps every run. The only meaningful difference each time is your choice of characters for your party. There's about 3-4 hours of content, and the game expects you to replay these 3-4 hours 10+ times. Bugs aside, I enjoyed my first playthough. If you're okay having a fairly solid but extremely short and repetitive game, this might be worth playing.

The core gameplay loop is similar to games like Slay the Spire or Into the Breach, except presented in the style of a traditional Japanese RPG. Each turn you're shown what the enemies are going to do, and your goal is to mess up the enemy plans. This ranges from setting up defences against known attacks, to delaying/stunning enemies, or just killing them before they attack. Each fight is to the death; you win every fight, or it's game over. Regardless of how your game ends, you can unlock a few new items for your future runs, and then you restart. After your first run you get to pick which characters you have, and each character plays completely different. This aspect of the game works well - one run I had a party that didn't do much damage, but they delayed the enemy so hard they could never take a turn. Another party had zero defensive ability, so their game plan was ""kill everything as fast as possible"". This does shake up how the game plays each run, but it's not enough to overcome the absence of campaign variety.

The deterministic gameplay model is interesting in theory. I hate RNG in strategic situations, so predictable combat is my jam. However there's a huge drawback to this game compared to Slay the Spire and Into the Breach: the combat predictions lie. The tutorial has a disclaimer saying the predictions might not be accurate, but this feels more like a disclaimer saying ""We couldn't fix a bug"" than a feature. This is very frustrating in practice. I've had fights where the game said I should be fine, only for me to die. I've had other fights where the game said my 5 characters would each take 300 damage, but the enemy actually did 5 randomly targeted shots of 60 damage. Some enemies are able to attack twice per turn, but the game doesn't tell you what their second attack is. Other enemies have on-death effects, and the game doesn't mention those either. Even more frustratingly, there's some enemies that attack between turns. I've had situations where I've entered combat with full shields/health, and had 1 of my characters killed before the first turn. My friend even had a total party wipe/game over without taking a turn. This system is fantastic when it works, but the inconsistency killed the fun for me, and is ultimately why I give it a thumbs down.

As mentioned earlier, this game is very buggy at the time of my review. In my first run the game regularly dropped to 1 fps when killing enemies (though this didn't happen in future runs), and I've had the game freeze multiple times requiring an alt-f4/restart. Sometimes the enemies visually in the back row are actually in the front row, other times the enemies visually in the front row are in the back row. This one is annoying as short range attacks cannot hit the back row, and I made catastrophic misplays because of this bug. There's a ton of minor bugs too, such as the map pathfinder causing my party to get stuck inside terrain, or enemies having the 'shields down' animation play several times in a row.

The UI also has major issues. The squad skills menu allows the mouse for the first 3 skills, but needs WASD to view the tooltip for the other (offscreen) skills. Some parts of the UI can only be navigated with WASD, some parts need ZX, other parts only work with the mouse. The post-game unlock menus have issues with both mouse and keyboard. I can't even work out how to accurately describe how broken they are; they dynamically resize in nonsensical ways that make it a chore to navigate. It feels like the devs didn't finish implementing the UI game-wide, which adds to the early access feel of the game. 

The mouse doesn't function well in combat either - the hitbox for characters isn't the same shape as their sprite. It's difficult to select a small character with the mouse if they're behind a big character.  This regularly leads to selecting the wrong unit, or being entirely unable to select a unit with the mouse. The penultimate boss seems to understand this bug, and summons a ridiculously large enemy to block their selection hitbox.  I've had skills target enemies I didn't click, and I've had skills activate when I tried to cancel targeting for them. I've also had the parallax foreground visually block my entire party in a couple of fights. It feels like the game was designed for a different input device, possibly the Switch given how everything feels too large on a PC monitor.

The art style is hit and miss. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not. I found the idle animations too visually noisy, but the attack animations were cool as heck. Star Renegades has one of the most satisfying flamethrower animations I've ever seen, for example. It's inconsistent though - it's like a different artist drew the combat sprites, the dialogue sprites, the squad menu art, and the trailer/cutscene art. Art's completely subjective though, so you should know if you like it or not based on the store page trailer/screenshots.

I also found the writing to be cringey. Almost every line of dialogue is a forced joke, and it doesn't work for me at all. It's a constant barrage of pop culture references, which really wore me down. I found it annoying from the very start, but it got worse over time. The reward for beating the game is a bunch of game developers sitting in the Star Wars cantina, desperately trying to be funny via breaking the fourth wall. I might sound harsh here, but the game would genuinely be improved by removing all dialogue instead of keeping it in the current form.

***

edit:
I'm adding this section after writing the review above. I'm not sure the Star Renegades we got is the Star Renegades we were promised. I've gone back over the preview coverage, rewatched the trailer, read some old articles etc, and so much of the game has been cut. It's actually verging on false-advertising.
 
Some examples from the trailer:
- The throne room has 11 groups of enemies plus an additional 'high command' group. In game there's 3 groups, and a solitary commander at the top. This suggest around 75% of the enemy commander content was cut between the trailer and the release.
- There's sections with with 6 characters in the player party. The game caps at 5.
- There's multiple battles on horizontally scrolling scenery. As far as I remember, this never happens in game.
- There's several large open maps to explore including one in a dense forest. These aren't in game
- The parent-turned-antagonist of the trailer doesn't exist in game.

Normally I wouldn't care too much about this, but this video is on the store page. There's also a screenshot on the store page which is misleading. It shows a map with multiple objectives for the player - defeat 2 squads and claim 4 anti-aircraft guns.

Good:

* Combat
* Visual style

Cons:

* Classes and upgrades lack depth
* Item system not interesting
* Relationship system not interesting
* Camp-site system not interesting

All of the cons roll up to limit the long term enjoyment of this game as a roguelike. 


The arty styles are really pretty and the atmosphere overall feels great. Story isn't great or particularly interesting, but that's okay for this genre of game (at least for me). The concept of the game is pretty cool, but it feels like it's trying to do too many things. It has roguelike - meaning a relatively shorter game with a lot of random elements and upgrades. The game tries to blend in RPG elements into the mix through developing a story, characters, and inter-character relationships. The problem with this is that in trying to go for both routes, it ends up not doing either of them particularly well. There are a bunch of fairly unique classes to choose from, but they have linear upgrade paths that are not really interesting. The growth of relationships between the characters is the same each time, and feels more tedious than interesting (and good god, the writing is a bit annoying). You get random item rewards from fighting, but none of them change your playthrough in an interesting or meaningful way (extra damage, cool). 

Combat looks really pretty, and feels good. This is one of the best takes on turn based combat that I've seen. There's a lot of depth with status effects, defense types, and more, but it's hard to learn and understand. There are some mechanics that could be simplifed or made more interesting.

This game feels a bit misleading.  You are not about to jump into a game full of tactical and strategic depth.  Instead, you'll be playing a game with beautiful pixel art, somewhat repetitive combat, minimal story, with some rpg elements.

It's good, but it isn't quite what the Beta or even the trailer makes you think you'll be playing.

The story isn't particularly strong or engaging, which is disappointing considering it has a very good premise.  There's a group of marauders answering to ""Mother"" that are dominating reality after reality.  You take the role of a group of characters that face this threat in any given reality.  When you die, your robot companion jumps to a new reality to try again.  This solves the problem of carrying over any progress for your characters, but it removes any meaningful attachment to the characters.  The ending reveal is fantastically disappointing.

Gameplay consists of moving around on 3 worlds and 1 space ship, where you'll breach into zones and attack or loot.  At first combat seems pretty in depth, but it rapidly devolves into a Stagger->Attack->Stun->Attack->Attack-Shield type of mechanic.  And that's pretty much every battle.  You want to keep your shields up and prevent as much damage to yourself as possible, as shields will regenerate at the end of every battle but health will not.  

You'll need 3 breaches before you can camp for the night and use cards to heal yourself.  This is also where you'll build your friendship level that builds some combo attacks and other bonuses with your characters.

You find new weapons on the battlefield, or buy them after liberating a planet.  I found this to be somewhat disappointing, as the weapons and gear I found/bought didn't often make the same jump in improvement as I'd expect considering my level gains.

Music, art, and the sound are all quite exceptional.  There's a lot of detail in the game, and a lot of love obviously poured into it.

Overall it's a fun game, and I've enjoyed it.  Don't go in expecting deep combat, story, or rpg elements and you'll have a good time.",1599955896,1599955896,True,2,0,0.536723136901855469,0,False,False,False,76561197970539229,10137,289,416,0,351,1599969787,,

Quick thoughts and information.

Choose a group of three murderers on your mission of robo genocide (there is a choice of three at the beginning, but you unlock more as you progress).  Pick carefully as group composition matters (there are specific archetypes).  On your murder spree, your team will gain levels, money and items.  All items are level locked and some can be used between classes, but weapons are generally not shared between classes.  Again, pick carefully as items and weapons have modifiers that can give you a huge advantage.  

There's a pretty steep learning curve, but once you get it, it gets very strategic.

Timeline.  Think of this as initiative.  The units to the far left act first.

You can tab between units or mouse click on them.  And, you can set their attacks before their initiative. Certain attacks knock enemies off the timeline (break) so they lose initiative, so they cannot attack that turn.  Keep in mind that you can't do this infinitely.  You can stun an enemy that you cannot break though.

After three turns, you can camp.  You will use cards you've gained to build bonds as well as add temporary bonuses for the next battle.  You can also regain shields or health if you have cards to do so.  *you can use the cards on yourself, but get no bond points.

Once you've reached a certain bond threshold (I believe it's broken up in three tiers), you gain permanent perks and eventually combos (which normally do not happen before the 3rd planet) that use Fury.

There are 3 planets and a ship.

Random money and DNA (used to level up) can spawn randomly as well as enemy ships that you can conquer (but, unfortunately cannot commandeer) for big prizes (money/DNA/weapons/gear).

You can go in almost any direction (that the map allows).  However, some points that are time locked and are not always the best routes or have the best rewards.

There's also a 'Nemesis' type system, akin to Shadow of War, in which if an enemy kills you they get stronger and get promoted.  On the opposite end, if you kill a leader on a planet, you get better rewards, usually DNA and credits (which are used to unlock characters).

There's also some currency that is used to make gear potentially available during your runs.

Each run is not short (30 minutes to hours).  Luckily, you can save and exit during the movement phase.

*yellow sign denotes how many times the enemies can be staggered.  I.e. pushed back on the timeline.  Even when they're off the timeline, if you use stagger skills, it will count against the enemy.  So, even if you performed a break and the enemy had 1 stagger left, performing another break will count against you.  It probably doesn't matter, since you'll probably be using another break, but it would be helpful to know so that you can save your most powerful stagger for the next round.

I had some initial reservations, but now that I've put some time it, it's pretty good so far.  I hope for more maps, units, gear and some more random/quirkiness.  Mod support or even randomly generated maps would be cool.

Recommended.

Note to devs:

Please make it so you know who on your team can and will attack first.  It can be frustrating when someone with less stagger attacks first.

Also, it does not say that you continue to stagger when enemies that are broken (break) off the timeline, thus without knowing, wasting a stagger.  However, if you let it be known that they are being pushed further back, that might help.

鍛え抜かれた少数精鋭のレジスタンスで悪の帝王を打ち倒すＪＲＰＧチックなストラテジー


このゲーム、一言で言うと・・・・
「とにかくなげえええええええええええええええええ！！！！！」
一回の戦闘がとにかく長いし、ターン制とストラテジーとローグライクが全然噛み合ってない上で、そこにＵＩのクソさ加減が乗っかって、操作と仕様にとにかく疲れる。
戦闘バランスもメチャクチャなせいで産廃スキルばっか、ダルすぎてマトモにやると頭オカシなるで・・・
俺はまあ・・・好きだけど、人に勧められるようなゲームじゃないのでサムズダウンしますよ
下にいつも通りの問題部分を書きなぐります。


英語ほぼ読めないんでストーリー類の事は置いておいてノーマルクリア、システム部分を羅列気味に書いていくが・・・
・まず最初にマップ、ＵＩ、その他もろもろ表記物が見辛いしキャラ小さいし、分かりにくいし、レスポンスがメチャ悪くてストレス。これが最初の難関で最後までついて回る一番のストレス。戦闘でも全く同じ事が言え、これが我慢できなかったらもうやめた方が良い。この先に倍々でストレス増えていく要素満載だからな。
・戦闘システムは分かる人に言えばほぼ「グランディア」、敵味方の行動をけん制・抑制してターンを制御して有利に進めていくタイプなのだが・・・画面ゴチャゴチャで何をしてるのか、まずは把握するのが大変。行動順や敵のステータス、バフ＆デバフ、ターゲットのわかりにくさに、一番大事な行動順を可視化したゲージが死ぬほど使い辛く、ずっとため息が出る。だああああああアイコン重なって誰から攻撃するか見えん！！！
・ローグライク要素は装備品にレベルが設定されている為、強いものを拾っても装備したいキャラのレベルが足りなければ装備できない仕様なので単純に喜びが薄い。各キャラ事に装備できる種類も違うためによりガッカリ感が増す。仲間もステージクリア時にランダムで二人の中から選んで加入できるが、なぜ一回目だけ仲間レベル１からなんだよ使い難いんじゃ
・宝箱がゲーム中にあり、その宝箱のアイテムを３つの中から１つを選び入手できるのだが・・・同じ種類の武器ばっか被る宝箱・・・せめて三種類全部違う種類にしてもらいたい。
・アイテムショップも存在しているのだが、別に入らないアイテムは売却できるなんて事はない。
・お金の入手方がほぼない、手に入ってもごく少量。手に入らないなら別にソレでいいのだが・・・ステージを進もうが入手量が増える訳でもないので財布は重くならない。
・そして。アイテムショップはステージを重ねる事に価格が爆上がりするので最後まで何も買えないなんて事は当たり前になるので、逆にイラついてくる。なんの為にあんのこれ？
・ドットダメージを与える状態異常は存在意義がない、固定ダメージの上に、ローグライクした装備品に必ずと言っていいほど自分が使うスキルより強力な状態異常付与が装備品に補完されてるし、そのせいで自分のスキルで状態異常を付ける意味も手間も無い。そのせいでほぼほぼスキルが産廃になっている。
・そして、敵の行動を遅らせる事が何より強いし大事なので状態異常の存在が薄くなっている。
・似た特殊効果の多さ、非常に分かりにくいし弱い。結果的に％ダメージアップの方が遥かに強いという罠
・アーマー値の存在。値の数だけダメージを軽減するのだが、これのせいで序盤は絶対にボスに勝てない仕様になっている。とにかく硬すぎる。アーマー値を大幅に削れるキャラやアイテムが無ければ負け確定。
・なのに敵の攻撃にはほとんどアーマー削りが付いており、自分のアーマー値は攻撃一発で剥がれるシールドの延長みたいな仕様。あっても無くても蚊ほどにもダメージ軽減なんてない。敵も必至こいてこっちのアーマー値削りにこいや！
・なので、選ぶキャラは指で数えるのも必要ないって言うアレ
・ボスの高火力＆全体攻撃＆回復＆謎の特殊行動。とにかく連続攻撃と高火力で押してくるだけのボス戦。第二ステージのネコロボはクソ。いやまじで。初見一時間近く掛かって倒したわ。ほんま開発頭湧いてる。
・ラストに近い敵もターンに関係ない全体攻撃と全体デバフ掛けてきて萎える
・前衛後衛の分かりにくさ。
・同じキャラを重複して連れていけない。
・クリティカル発生の仕様の謎さ加減
・イベントと言う名の・・・また戦闘かよ！！！！なげええよ！！無条件でなんかアイテムとかよこせよ！！！！
・なぜか一律じゃない各キャラの要求経験値。なにを基準にそれぞれ要求値が違うんだ？？？
・戦闘中しょっちゅう喋ってテンポの悪いボス戦
・突如削除された日本語
・とにかくＵＩ、画面がゴチャゴチャ（二回目）
・あまり意味を成していないアンロック要素と持ち込みできる装備、貧弱すぎるし１Lv状態で体感できる効果は少ない。
・最序盤がアイテムもレベルも仲間も弱いだけでソコだけが理不尽なだけで、中盤からは難易度ガバガバでゲーム性に疑問
・難易度設定も敵の行動をキャンセルできる仕組みなせいで意味を成してない。
・本当にいらないサポートタイプな子達・・・上記したように装備品で賄えるし、単純にステータスも火力も激ヨワ。取り柄のバフスキルも序盤じゃ効果弱すぎて使えないし、終盤では装備品の効果に負けるし、そのころには他のタンクやアタッカー達が攻撃ついでにバフデバフを付与できちゃうと言う・・・謎の存在よ
・少ない敵の種類と同じ構成の敵ＰＴばっか、ボスも属性違いの使い回しばかりで戦略性と言う言葉なんてなかった。
・交友度の分かりにくさ。なにがどのキャラに左右するか非常に分かりづらい、友好度が高いと仲がいい者同士がいるとパッシブスキルが発動するが、何が貰えるかは有効度を上げないと分からない仕組みの為、初見は「なんだこれ」と面倒に感じる。
・それに関連して上記の状態異常も含め、多数の産廃有効度上げカード達
・フレンドコンボの使い勝手の悪さ、簡単に言うと合体技。まず習得するには有効度を上げないといけないし、それまでは絶対に使えない仕様に、かならずＰＴ二名の行動を消費する為に結果的に使いどころがほぼない。下手すると通常スキルより弱いモノのあるので疑問。
・そんな大変な仕様だというのに、友情パワーなど知った事じゃねえ！と言わんばかりの合体技に抵抗持ち（ダメージ軽減＆デバフ無効）と言うアホくさい敵が居るって言う
・敵のカウンター類の仕様の理不尽さ。
・一部キャンセルできないスキル、ＵＩがクソな為に操作ミスをして引き返せなくなる。敵の行動を制御するのが大事なゲームなのにね？？
・そしてなぜか最後には倒されると即ゲームオーバーの攻撃どころか防御も出来ないも出来ない1Lvキャラが追加され、意味不明な縛りプレイをさせられる、しかも敵はそのゴミを優先的に狙ってくる。おかげでそのゴミを守る為に味方の行動さえ吸われ今まで何のためにキャラを育ててきたのか理解不能なる。バランス調節出来ないからって即ゲームオーバーにさせるシステムを組み込むアホさ加減よ。
・ゲームクリアするとクリア時に組んでいたＰＴから一名がラスボスに設定され次のゲームで選択することが出来なくなる。ここで強キャラ持っていかれたら・・・まあ苦労してクリアしてもなぜか意味不明な縛りを強要される。
・クリア後に手に入るキャラ「PARAGON」は明らかにゲームシステムにそぐわない性能。おまえらちゃんとテストプレイしたんか？？？敵のシールド吸いながら戦うキャラなのだが・・・敵のシールドがなくなったら活躍しする場面もなくなりタンクとしても要らない、動きも遅いしアーマー削りも微妙。攻撃性能もアイテムでドレイン効果必須のスキルばかり（だとして、他のキャラにドレインを持たせた方が遥かに強いのは言うまでもないが・・・）最初から終盤まで居ても居なくても問題ないゴミをアンロックしてどうすんだ
・とにかくＵＩ、画面がゴチャゴチャ（三回目）


なんか他にも細々と快適を損ねるプチストレスな仕様が多いけど、単純に「戦闘がクソ」「ＵＩがクソ」で纏められる事が多い。
初見の状態では何ができるか分からないので多彩な戦略性があるのか？！と錯覚してしまうが、少しコツを覚えれば大分底が浅いことに気づかされる。
そして、やればやるほど悪い点が見つかっていくのに驚くぜ！！
こんなクソ仕様に反逆してクリアまでやったが、反抗したところで満足感はなかった・・・

75843165,english,"This game is delightful, albeit quite ball-bustingly difficult. The graphics are amazing, every pixel an eye-gasm. The combat has both incredible strategic depth as well as heart-pounding adrenaline, as a single slip up in a fight usually means game over. Speaking of which, it's a rogue-lite, so a game over means you start from the beginning. The emotional and time investment for a single run is absolutely immense, but thankfully the game carves it up into bite-size chunks so you can pick it up and play for an in game day (30-45 minutes of playtime, depending on how fights go) then save and exit and continue with your day. I would recommend playing a run over a few real-life days, as playing for too long might burn your strategic thinking out, and cause you to make dumb mistakes. Probably the most brutal part of the game are the boss fights. In my opinion they are WAY too difficult, bosses usually have multiple thousands of HP while your team at the time maybe has a tenth of their damage output and health. But it feels oh so good to knock them down a few pegs. In addition, your squad can also develop a relationship with one another, with strong bonds giving both touching dialogue and massive bonuses, and if they become close enough, they may unlock a Combo, an ultimate ability that both squad members use at the same time, and it is completely overpowered in the best possible way. There's also an Adversary system that procedurally generates minibosses with distinct personalities and quirks. The story is also brilliant, though I won't spoil it for you. In addition, characters have reactive dialogue that reflects what's going on around them, making them seem like real people.

1.敵よりも早く攻撃を当てればCRITボーナス（追加効果）が発生する
2.CRITボーナスにはStagger（緑の時計アイコン）が存在し、Staggerを当てると敵の行動を遅らせることができる

上記4つを理解していれば攻略は難しくはないだろう。しかし、Staggerスキルを全く持たないメンバーも存在し、後半には敵のアーマーを削れる攻撃が必須となるため必然的にパーティーメンバーの組み合わせは固定化してくる。

キャンプで友情値をMAXの4まで高めれば子孫が誕生し新しいキャラもアンロックできるがそれには周回が必要になる。

[u] THE GOOD [/u]

Visuals are phenomenal, animations are [b]punchy[/b] and fun to look at. Gameplay feels solid.
Be warned this is definitely a slower kind of game with turn planning etc.
I generally feel like I am in control of the outcomes and fight mechanics feel rewarding. 

[u] THE MEH [/u]

Feels like there's a character balancing issue. Navigating the maps and UI is slow and counter-intuitive and can feel like a chore at times. Environments and some fights can get a little repetitive. Items and the shop feel a little out of place and like an afterthought, as do the status effects which aren't obvious what they actually do until you use them a few times and figure it out. Lack of readability overall

[u] THE UGLY [/u]

Many game breaking bugs are present, for example I've been reliably losing runs to softlocks after beating bosses. I'm someone who will give the benefit of the doubt but it is becoming a struggle to enjoy this game when I physically cannot complete a run because the game is softlocking, crashing or directing itself into an eternal loop. And when those runs take a few hours a piece, it ends up being a bitter pill to swallow altogether.

Although you start with 3 characters, you can unlock more as you play.  There's also secret characters that you can unlock by building the relationships between your existing ones.  Gear variety improves as you unlock new tiers and new types using in game resources that you earn by playing.  If you lose, it's not game over as you then get to spend your earned resources to make yourself stronger and continue the gameplay loop.  

Some gripes would be that when picking what item to upgrade, the current abilities of your characters aren't easily accessible to view, which could affect your choice as a 1/3 pick.  The size of the UI should probably be tweaked a little bit so that one you have a lot of abilities to use for a character, the menu doesn't hide such a big portion of the screen.  Finally, the boss of the first planet should be tweaked so that more team varieties are able to defeat him.

75814356,english,"It is with a heavy heart that I leave a negative review for Star Renegades. When this game shines, it is triumphant. As is directly evident, the art direction is nothing but mindblowing. The trailer is glorious, the combat mechanics show innovation, and the gameplay systems appear promising. It had me heavily invested. Unfortunately, with the exception of the artwork, the game fell apart for me rather quickly.

[WARNING: HUGE WALL OF TEXT INCOMING, IF NOT INTERESTED IN DETAILS, JUMP TO SUMMARY BELOW]

Generally, the combat heavily incentivizes conservative and exploitative strategies. You have three protective stat pools ensuring your survival (armor, health and shield), of which only shields regenerate after every battle. Basically, you want to avoid any damage surpassing your shields, which makes protecting / shield-healing characters a necessity to persevere the extended fights and hard-hitting enemies. In my very first playthrough, I struggled because I failed to mitigate enough damage, and died to the final boss (behemoth) of the second level. In the second run, I went with Aegis (tank / protective support), Archon (AoE / shield heal), and a shooter as damage dealer. Once the dual wielding space marine guy (stagger / stunner) joined my team, my strategy was set in stone. Stagger enemies, and if the stagger limit had been reached, stun them to prevent their heavy attacks. In between, heal and protect as much as possible, to conserve the valuable HP, and attack when a safe opening presents itself. From the second level on, until the last boss, all strategy was boiled down to a boring rinse and repeat. The inability to skip combat animations did not help either.

Sadly, when expanding on the promising combat system, the designers mistook arbitrary complexity for meaningful choices. There are so many layers of systems attached. Guard / retaliation stances, front line enemies blocking access to the backliners, items with frequently useless stats, short-lived buffs or DoTs, linear hero level ups without branching paths. Stuff regularly matters too little, and if it matters (like the accessibility of the enemies), it often feels like a nuisance (which, unluckily, seems to be a constant theme throughout the experience). For instance, you can min max quite a bit with the items, unequip a weapon that transforms your damage type to a certain one the next enemy resists, equip a health drain weapon once you are hurt and you want to recover (which is a rare occasion aside the camp fires), and so on. But on average, the effects are weak, and in order to leverage them, you have to overcome a lack of clarity and transparency. Speaking of the camp fires, you will cross similarly unfulfilling mechanisms, convoluted and inefficient. Friendship builds up slowly, but is tied to the other boons, such as minor short-timed resistances against obsurce damage types. But you do not know whether these things will be useful against your next enemies. In the end, you can min max things for sure, but for me it felt obtuse, and I focused on the big stats of immediate importance and clear function (keeping health, shield and armor in the best possible condition).

In the end, I fought battles with the UI as much as with my enemies. The UI is unintuitive, does not display information efficiently, and requires too much input to navigate. At the last boss fight, your party comprises six members, and you fight a boss supported by two tentacle monsters. In this crowded screen, the character models overlap a lot, making the act of cancelling a party member’s action, testing / redirecting attacks, and selecting the boss in his tentacle mess [summing up: the core gameplay] incredibly tedious. At times, I just gave up and submitted my turn orders, despite being not optimal, due to sheer frustration. Given the punishing nature of the game, this is not a good call.

Traversing the map is just as frustrating, due to the nonexisting pathfinding and need for constant clicking and confirmation. Running back through the little segmented areas to catch the bonus resources dropped on the map during the night, which could have just been directly given to the player. Was it a purposeful design decision to make things feel retro from a utility perspetive as well, or were such features not properly playtested?

Also, the writing is plain disappointing. [spoiler] At the climax of the game, just before the final boss, you expect to fight this corrupted version of your heroine that has been teased in the trailer. Instead, you are given some utmost bland multiverse lore. Ending with the statement that due to the laws of nature, you are unable to meet another version of yourself, and thus are fighting someone else. Which directly contradicts the trailer and your expectations up to this point, and turns the possibly most anticipated moment of the whole game into the most severe story disappointment. [/spoiler] In between, there are no real story payoffs as well. The characters are meant to be fun, but end up being overly simplistic, stereotypical and annoying. There are neat moments (those easter eggs in the Cantina, for instance), but they are too few and far between.


TL;DR:

I am in love with the visual style, and recognize the huge efforts and thoughts that obviously went into this work. At the same time want to scream in frustration. Considering the sluggish and underwhelming gameplay loop, I do not feel drawn back after completing the game once. The progeny features, the evolving adversaries, the oftentimes weirdly useless random equipment, all those layers of stats, it simply does not matter enough.

If I compare this missing attachment with the spirit a less fancy looking, lengthy and intricate but - from a mechanistic point of view - extremely tightly designed marvel such as Monster Train can evoke in me, I simply have to speak out here. I do not regret my purchase, supporting an indie studio with such amazing artistic talent, even if the game did not work out for me in the end. But if you desire that beloved long-term engaging roguelite experience with its endless replayability and great value for money - be aware that the experience behind the grand visuals might end up unexpectedly lackluster.

If you want deep and engaging tactical combat, here you'll find none. 

Overall the game is rather meh.

Graphics are intended to look like pixelated-2D in 3D, not unlike Octopath Traveler. Sometimes they do, and sometimes they just look cheap.

Character protraits look a bit weird and/or ugly.

The gameplay consists of moving on map, unlocking areas using limited resource and dispatching the enemies in each area via Halcyon-like tactical combat of 3 vs 3. The main tactics is controlling the enemy, delaying his turn as much as possible.
I've played Kingmaker, Divinity: OS2 and Battle Brothers recently, and after those games combat feels really shallow.

The plot is ... well, the 1.5 hours I've played, the plot felt banal and uninspired. The writers tried to be funny with toungue-in-cheek dialogues, but produced something cringeworthy and stupid.

75809746,english,"It's like Octopath Traveler, but all of the budget went into the gameplay and the impressive visuals and pixel art. Meaning there's no Cyrus' voice lines carrying the vibe of every fight or epic high budget soundtrack blasting through your headphones as the game ramps up to its more intense moments, but at least the more in-depth gameplay and roguelike mechanics allow for replayability and experimentation, making every run feel fresh.

There's a lot of borrowed ideas I see in this game, of which 2 are game defining:

[list]
[*] Grandia timeline with crits pushing enemy (or ally) actions
[*] Rounds instead of Clock Turn system and the ability to break enemies (or allies) out of a round through smart exploitation of stagger attacks (thus the aforementioned comparison to Octopath Traveler)
[/list]

The game feels really satisfying to play once you figure out the flow of it. There are a lot of different setups and team compositions as well as builds through randomly rolled equipment you can experiment with, giving this game a ton of replayability especially compared to something like a streamlined RPG experience like Octopath.

Overall, this is a huge step-up in terms of presentation compared to Halcyon 6. I hope that one day, these developers get the chance to make an actual high budget game with these concepts and ideas, because it will truly rival Octopath Traveler, which in my opinion is still the gold standard of this specific niche at least in recent years.

Runs can last up to 6-8 hours if you reach the end, and all that progress would be for nothing if you encounter a game-breaking bug, and the autosave will force you to loop said bug until you abandon you run.

I've beaten the game and played through the hard difficulty and I think with this game I'm basically stuck at the conclusion that it's yet another game developed by people who don't actually play a lot of video games.

Overall, what moves me off the fence on this game is the lack of respect it has for the player's time.  No animation speed or skip ability that doesn't involve holding the spacebar the entire time I'm playing the game, really?  You knew that players would want to ff/skip animations after seeing them a billion times and didn't include a checkbox to make this always the case?  Come on.

Lots of other time-wasting crap like the campfire dialog that can't be skipped is a clear indication to me that the developers didn't think anyone would want to play their game more than once, or just didn't care.

As far as the game itself, it's alright.  It's functional.  The big issue is that it's easily solved.  Do you want to win?  Okay, here's what you do, you pick the hero with two pistols who has an instant super-delay ability AND a stun ability, and you just keep breaking stuff with delays and then stunning it when it's got temporary immunity to delays.  Done.  That's the combat, solved.

I could go on on stuff like the unsatisfying Diablo style loot or the terrible presentation of information (especially on attacks), but ultimately I think it comes down to the fact that there's just not anything here worth getting excited for.

There's an overworld map you can explore... using the clunkiest movement system I've ever experienced in a game. An odd system of click-to-move with terrible pathing, and an infuriating quirk of having to constantly click on transition zones to travel across bridges or climb stairs to the next tiny area. Honestly there is nothing added to the gameplay by being able to move freely. It might as well just be a static map.

The battle UI is clunky and requires too many clicks and menus to do simple actions. Instead of useful popups when mousing over enemies, you just see generic icons for weaknesses and a resistances, but can't actually tell what those resistances or weaknesses are without clicking into a separate inspect interface. Heck, you don't even see damage numbers outside of it. I've seen far more elegant visual representations of deterministic combat. This just makes an already slow game feel even slower.

When you actually do start combat, it quickly boils down to repeating the same pattern each and every turn, healing shields, staggering and attacking. There is certainly something to the order of attacks, but rather than an interesting puzzle to solve, it quickly devolved into a chore you have to do. After a battle I didn't feel clever. I felt tired. I think the designers found that the system of breaking opponents was a bit too exploitable, so they buffed enemy HP to compensate, but the end result is that fights last way too long. Shorter more lethal combat would be more interesting I think.

75793909,english,"As of this review I've played for about 18 hours. My compy specs are: i5-4460 3.2ghz, 16gb RAM, GeForce GTX 980, Win 10. I've experienced no bugs or crashes.

This game is amazing. You're a simple robot just minding your own business in your pokeball one day when suddenly, ""J5T-1N I choose you!"" BAM! Welcome to the end of the world (this version of it at least). Now some crazy scientist wants you to drag a bunch of useless renegades around while you do all the work saving the dimension from an alien invasion. The worst part is you aren't even getting paid #botrights.

[h1]Menu/Options[/h1]
Really limited in graphics options. There's just resolution, framerate, vsync, and screenshake. While this game isn't insane on the graphics end, it would've been nice to have a gamma slider and an epilepsy compensation of some sort as it is super flashy at times.

[h1]The Meta Loop[/h1]
The bulk of the game centers around you (J5T-1N) leading your party of renegades to liberate planets being sieged by interdimensional aliens. At the start of a fresh run you'll be in a hub area where you can spend your meta currency on roster unlocks and weapons/gadgets/implants (each char can carry up to 3 items, the norm is 1 weapon, 1 implant, 1 gadget but, some chars have variants like 2 weapons, 1 gadget). There are also 3 run upgrades available that can really help in the higher difficulties (armor repair in camp and new merchants after liberating a planet). Once you've made your purchases you can select 3 renegades to accompany you from your unlocked roster (2 for me tho, I always bring one of the Syphex siblings cuz their cool) and choose their perks. Eventually, after your first & second planet liberation, you'll get to choose 2 more squad members from random pairs. You even get a mysterious and all-powerful 6th member if you reach the MOTHERship.

Each map (planet) is broken into multiple sections that you have to explore for loot and enemies before a behemoth fight where you liberate the planet. You have 3 days to explore and each day you can move to 3 new spaces (that are connected to your currently liberated territory). The enemy may attempt to lock random spaces which prevents you from going to them and can be a huge pain in the ass really (they can't lock sections you've claimed already thankfully and you can travel freely within your own liberated territory). My first couple runs I’d often end up trapped on day 2 with all routes blocked so I had to just start the behemoth fight with wasted time. Each section may contain enemies, bosses, loot, food cards, money, heals (one each for shield, armor, and health) and/or nothing. You can see the entire map from the start and what's on each section although the mouseover can be tricky sometimes, especially with enemies next to turrets. I plan my entire route at the start and then adjust as the enemy tries to lock areas.

After you've liberated 3 new sections it'll become night and you can choose to camp (which refreshes your 3 moves). While camping you can use cards in a system similar to the darkest dungeon camp. You have 6 points to spend and each card costs a varying amount. The twist is that all your party members have affection bars with each other. Leveling up the affection will give the involved party members stat buffs and powerful combo moves (not gonna tell you the duo but, if you unlock ""Decimate"" you pretty much won the whole run on easy). The card effects vary from stuff like temp/perm stat buffs to armor/health heal. Once 3 days pass or you activate the quest marker, you'll make a final camp then go fight the behemoth on a separate map. The behemoth fights can vary in difficulty and my first run I actually found the bosses (alien commanders of the planet) to be harder in most cases (excluding the final behemoth on the 3rd planet). After you liberate 3 planets, you'll make a final assault on the enemy MOTHERship. Win or lose you'll end up back at the HUB.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Combat is turned-based with a timeline and deterministic. Every unit goes once per round (unless you or the enemy has a buff that says otherwise) and is placed on the timeline based on the move they are using (bigger attacks place you farther back on the timeline). If your attack lands before your targets turn you will crit which adds damage and additional effects to your attacks (same if the enemy attacks you before you move). Many moves can also push targets farther back on the timeline and if a unit goes past the end it will ""break"" and be pushed into the next round (effectively skipping their turn). The tutorial is very well done and explains the mechanic. Each side has 2 rows of 3 (front and back). The back row normally can't be attacked unless the entire front row has been destroyed or the attack being used has vantage (can target any row, the symbol is a person in crosshairs). During the opening area and I think most/all of the first planet anybody can target anybody.

Overall, the combat is super neat. I really love the flashy moves and setting up combos. Chaining a boss for multiple turns is nice too. I had a fight where my tank went down (I underestimated the fortress ability) and I was able to barely win because I held the bosses turn off by chaining pushes and stuns.

[h1]Graphics/UI[/h1]
The game is super pretty straight up. It really reminds me of dungeon of the endless for some reason. During combat there are flashy moves with explosions and such going off so setting up your big move is super satisfying.

[h1]Things I didn't like[/h1]
The UI in combat can get really annoying in the mid/late game. Once you get enough moves you just can't see your debuffs anymore because the list covers it. You can get around this by going into inspect mode then holding ""x"" on the keyboard while hovering over your char. Also, when you fight big groups of enemies, they all overlap each other on the timeline, and it becomes hard to tell who's attacking who and when. You can individually hover over enemies to track their paths, but this becomes hard because of my next dislike. The mouseover sensitivity is horrible, everywhere. In combat clicking on your backrow guys is pretty finicky, you can tab through the ones that haven’t selected a move but, you can only cancel a move by clicking on them. There is a simple list of your chars in the bottom left but you can't click select on it for whatever reason. Also, the same when inspecting the enemies and you have to do the select unit then navigate your cursor to the info window without moving over anybody else in order to open the effects box. Outside of combat everything seems to have either too small or too big an area. I'll click around 2 or 3 times trying to go across a bridge but, trying to hover over a unit next to a turret is its own challenge mini game. Those are really my only two problems and both I’d consider to be annoyances more than problems. Also, I hate that the enemies lock areas of the maps because it makes me have to pay attention :(.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
10/10. I've beaten the game on easy and I’m on my 2nd run on medium and I've barely started unlocking stuff. I'm not sure this means that the loop is too small as you do earn more of the meta currency on higher difficulty levels. Each planet can take 30+ mins depending on your choices, so an entire run is about 2+ hours without losing.

75793339,english,"This game has awesome graphics and general ideas are good but in the end it fails in pretty much every aspect.

First of all officer system is way too overadvertised. New Behemoths are exactly the same as the ones you kill and this whole ""promotion"" thing is also joke. I've got Lt who gets beaten but retreats every run on 1st planet yet he wasn't promoted to next one nor degraded. Same with others who were not taking part in fight. The max they may get is Lt of their own planet and that's it.

Then there are unlocks. Yeah I know it's more roguelite than roguelike but base content is so damn limited, especially in terms of characters. Also this progeny business is bs because you don't get those characters for starting teams anyway.

Getting relations is straight up annoying. Nothing more to say.

Balance in this game is pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. Only 1 healer, 1 dedicated tank, 1 half-assed tank then there are damage dealers with 1 support buffer in the mix. It would be ok if not the fact that on planet 2 shield damage gets so crazy that the only viable option is the Archon, 1 of those frontlines, dps and maybe some support, but generally dps.

And the last but not least fight management aka breaking. After a while you start understanding that unless it's AOE attack breaking often becomes liability than feature because enemy will have early initiative which you can't break anymore and healing shield actually is more beneficial than delaying inevitable attack.

75788031,english,"I'm not sure if I personally like this game that much. The normal gameplay loop is ok and has good pacing, but the boss encounters feel like such slogs with them having tons of HP/shield/armor. To top that off they have an ability to regen a large chunk of that. This makes the bosses take a loooooong time even if you've found an equilibrium from some specific rotation you can do where you don't lose hp and the boss loses hp in the mean time. 
Bosses also have almost insta kill moves, which usually don't matter much since you can defend during those, but they will wipe you if you make a mistake or if you just have a team that cannot break the boss from the early timeline positions and the boss happens to target someone you can't save. Kinda cheesy, but not that bad considering it's a hard game either way. I'd be more ok with the wipes if the runs weren't so goddamn long especially with the bosses being a large part of that run length.

Other than that, the normal combat is fun and engaging. Elites kinda don't seem to matter too much. They just feel like a bit tougher normal enemy and the weaknesses/strengths barely came into play in a way that actually made a difference. But they still weren't a bad thing. Equipment is interesting enough and there's enough characters to make runs different if you want to.

The bosses kinda kill the game for me, so I can't recommend paying 25€ for this experience if you happen to feel the same. 
I likely won't play again unless they retune the pacing on the bosses. I don't feel like the game respects my time in that sense.

75784912,english,"Pretty fun, at least on the first run.

Main issue I have is that there's really one core mechanic - the stagger mechanic - and it feels like in order to be successful you really have to optimize that. Everything else is incremental benefit as getting an extra turn or an extra crit is more important than pretty much any other consideration.

What that means is that in most cases, due to the way stagger resistance works, there are only two useful actions:
1) The action that staggers the longest
2) The action that does the most damage without any stagger.
Everything else is usually a trap, or only useful to unload some damage into a stagger-immune enemy. There are some nuances with stuns or trying to remove armor or whatnot, but most of it doesn't really change the core combo of Blitz -> Kill Shot. 

This consideration also really makes some gear combinations pretty bad. Affixes attaching a small stagger on your attacks? Generally terrible, unless it buffs your one good stagger move. More damage? Almost useless unless it's on a rifle (slight exaggeration, but not as much as you'd think).

It's be a lot better if stagger resist worked on a break basis, rather than on a per application basis, so comboing lesser stagger abilities had a place.

Issues, I am a completionist so I get really bothered that even when I kill the level boss I cannot clear the rest of the map. Instead you are forced to the ""liberation"" area to buy and etc. I find it inconvenient and bothersome when I look at the imperium hierarchy and see officers i was strong enough to kill slip away. I suggest placing a bonus function after defeating the behemoth where the player is not allowed to camp but they can keep clearing the rest of the stage. This presents a risk reward type of situation where the player can risk their entire run if they die to clear the rest of the stage.

Please move the camp button when it is night time to a corner of the screen and not right in the middle where it can be accidentally clicked since it's pretty sizeable.

I personally did not like that parts of the map lock down after each day. I am just nit picky on this one, I am the type of person that likes to explore.

Combat that tells you what you need to know and UI that shows the rest, letting you immediately start taking well informed actions that are fun and rewarding to use.

Obviously since this is a roguelike game that you will be restarting from some point and seeing elements you've seen before, this pacing isn't necessarily going to continue indefinitely through all playtime, but it definitely has enough elements that the complexity and replayability will be there at that point.

Camping - Darkest Dungeon

Nemesis System - Shadow of Mordor

Split Journey in first map - Slay the Spire

The problem is it implements them poorly and in the end it just ends up as a weird mix. It's obvious they needed more time to flash them out and to work more on the game in general. There are missing keybindings so you have to do everything with a mouse. This can get frustrating when you have to close several tabs many times just to go into inventory etc. 

Game is missing tooltips to explain information to you and at the beginning will overwhelm you with stats. That said the game becomes quite easy very fast and the story mode lasts only about 5 - 10 hours. There is about 5 - 10 hours more of content for unlocking characters and gear but that's it. 10- 20 hours of content while Hades has 200+ hours of content and I'm still unlocking stuff there and they cost the same. So I really hope the developer will continue developing the game with patches (especially to add keybindings) and add DLCs.

The writing is trying to be funny but it's often not and starts repeating itself very early in the game.

Why do I still recommend this game? There just isn't many games of this type on the market and even though this game is flawed it's quite addictive and fun once you get through the mentioned issues.

I still think they would be better making Halcyon 6 second game and expanding on what they already made as it seems they did not have enough time or resources to fully develop this new title. But if you like this type of tactical games it's worth playing.

75772935,english,"This game is extremely fun. I would highly recommend it. The pixel art and animations are really nice. The dialogue is pretty funny at times and is pretty great. I would also like to say this game is highly replayable because of how the story works so far to me playing the game. The game is very much like Into The Breach in that you keep jumping into parallel universes to fight the invading threat. The characters that i have played with are really fun to use and over all I feel that the beginning team is the strongest. The character sprites I really like especially the first character you play as. Her animations I feel are extremely solid. The combat is very fun and later fights really make you think on when to use certain abilities and when to save certain ones. The soundtrack and effects are also really great to listen to.

Now for my complaints of the game. After a point characters will have a lot of abilities to use in combat, but for some reason they start blocking your status effects. So I can't read what the effect is doing since an ability is blocking the whole text. My other concern is that the game has a lot of moments of flashing which if you have epilepsy I would steer clear of this game because of certain attacks and deaths having massive white flashes. My last issue is that the lack of options in the option menu. It would have been nice to disable the game pause when not focused so that I could do other things while playing. Without this the game becomes really time consuming because of how long fights can last. There is a fast forward option in fights, but I would prefer to be able to multitask while playing strategy games.

[h1] The Obvious Stuff: [/h1]
This game's approach on pixelart is absolutely awesome in my opinion, but i know that not everyone likes pixelart in general. 
The music is good and fitting, but it won't blow your mind. 
The story is a very simple setup to justify replayability.

[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]
[b] Combat: [/b] Each round the game shows you what action the enemies are preparing and when they intend to execute them. Like theirs, your actions too take some time to prepare and you have to plan on how to hit the enemy before they can attack. If you succeed in doing so, you will crit and delay the opponent's attacks for a limited amount of times. There is almost no RNG involved, since crits aren't random and the damage of every attack is previewed exactly. 
Very different characters, attack types, enemy types, weapons and gadgets manage to create enough depth, despite the deterministic nature of the combat system.
Nevertheless, there are two major quality-of-life-issues: 
The UI can become very cluttered, when there are many characters with buffs/debuffs active. This can go to a point, where there is vital information hidden underneath overlapping UI parts.
Secondly the controls are far from perfect. Some just don't feel intuitive, while others are just outright clunky.
Overall combat feels great, though, but be prepared to bring a calculator.

[b] The Overworld: [/b] Between fights you ""travel"" to different areas on the overworld (Which means clicking on the entrance to these areas). These areas can be empty, contain looting/healing opportunities and/or have fights/traps. Again RNG is not the biggest factor, as you  can see the contents of every area from the beginning and consequently can plan your way towards the next boss fight.
Sadly, in turn the controls feel clunky and the pathfinding of your party on the map is rather non-existent.

[b] Camping: [/b] Each time you traveled to three new areas your party sets up camp. Camping works pretty much exactly the way it does in Darkest Dungeon: Your characters have different healing abilities and buffs they can apply to each other. Each ability costs some ""time points"", which you only have a limited amount of each night.
The new aspect is, that your characters also bond while camping which unlocks (rather simple) conversations, further passive abilities, combo attacks and more. This brings even more depth, but also more UI problems.

[b] The ""Cycle"": [/b] Since the game calls itself a rougelite you restart your run when you beat the final boss or fail beforehand. You then can spend resources collected during your previous runs to unlock weapons and gadgets, which can then appear as loot in the coming runs. You can also buy characters which you can use for your party in the next runs.
It's definitely not the most innovative system, but it keeps you going nonetheless.

[h1] tl;dr [/h1]
If you liked Darkest Dungeon for more than it's style and the narrator, you will most definitely like this game.
If you like turn-based, tactical RPGs and you can accept some flaws in terms of controls and UI, you will most definitely like this game.
If you have no idea of turn-based, tactical RPGs, but you're interested in this game nonetheless, just go for it. You will make some progress even if you suck, since it's a rougelite. The game is definitely worth it's price.",1599763134,1599763973,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198052399963,134,8,4705,0,557,1607371190,,

75757548,english,"The Rougelite genre is getting pretty crowded these days but Star Renegades is a quality addition. At it's heart is a great combat system which at higher difficulties asks for careful planning and consideration of how your team will work together. The major enemies certainly start off feeling unfair with huge damage spikes but as you learn your skills you can work out how to manage them effectively.

With thirteen characters too choose from and some distinctive equipment choice runs have good variety in terms of your team. Paired with procedural maps and a light implementation of the “nemesis” system first seen in Shadow of Mordor there is plenty of replay ability, though I do feel it would benefit from a few more random events.

The visuals are highly stylised and the animations are well done. The music is fine but not one of the games stronger points. The story and writing is amusing, though lightweight, but keep the gaming ticking along and definitely made me laugh as it went along.

I’d certainly recommend it, though it might be more fun for people already used to the genre as the bosses are probably a little punishing for beginners.

Usually I'm pretty patient but I wanted to play this one right away, I'm glad I did and it lived up to my expectations. It's a fun combat system where enemy actions are revealed before they happen, it's your job to interrupt, cancel and outright decimate them as much as possible before their turns (and attacks) pop off. The battles aren't easy, the pace is less forgiving, but if you get a little lucky you'll pull through.

The camp mechanic isn't a new thing but it's a way to build this idea that you're a team on a mission. There should be more variety in dialogue between the crew but overall it's good fun. You're given a choice at the end of each level to bring on a new character (class) and right away need to figure out how best to integrate them into the squad. 

There should be a better overall progression system, better permanent boosts. Right now they're lackluster. In Hades or Darkest Dungeon I feel stronger each time I journey out, not so much here.

The second planet's artwork felt identical to the first, change and variety are good things. Shell out the money for another artist to come in and create the assets. 

Save system needs to be updated, auto save should be available. This game does have a habit of locking up/freezing mid battle. That could mean 5 minutes it could be 2 hours of game time lost. That's a cardinal sin, fix it.

2.音乐：B 中规中矩吧 该有的都有 但并不让我觉得余音绕梁
3.游戏系统：A
总体+：优点是卡牌和点数设计点类似桌游，简单但富有策略型。缺点是不能随时保存，和暗黑一样是保存并退出，敌人小头目每次击败玩家都会变强，抱歉我不喜欢这种模式。
战斗系统++：打断和暴击十分有趣，没有命中暴击率的赌狗系统，可以方便查看敌人攻击方式和弱点提高策略性，随着战场人数的提高和升级选择会越来越难，上面的行动条会预测对方被延迟后的位置，能击杀对方还会专门显示致命一击图标，总之细节多机制有趣十分OK。
地图探险+：有一定的策略性，出入口没有明显提示不太好点；另外虽然有许多问号可探查地点，但是大都没有卵用，如果认为角色触发的对话是奖励的话也算有用吧。
成长养成+：升级系统学技能提高策略性有趣，但是不能保留到下一关让养成的快感消失。人物培养感情不错，但是贵圈关系很乱，跨种族恋爱生小孩真是一口老槽。
4.游戏剧情：？ 玩的不多，目前感觉一般大片剧情，你懂得，就是关于时间空间平行宇宙那些2020年已经老一套的东西，人物的牺牲也不够感人
5.其他:C
代入感（个人向）--：不能选性别，女主角无代入感，我不喜欢和男人生猴子；或许是政治正确的原因，女主又黑又丑；多人之间乱七八糟的关系，自由的RBQ之旅。
游戏修改（个人向）--：虽然是单机游戏，但是难以修改，我喜欢愿意大大方方让玩家修改的游戏，最好能支持创意工坊，这样不仅仅是能省时（比如提高游戏速度，快速升级查看汇总不同人物升级技能目录，对不想打的关卡跳关等，对好感系统不感冒的，可以快点看所有人的关系结局等），也能延长玩家的游戏时间（虽然有的修改会减少玩家的游戏寿命，不过这也是玩家的自由不是吗？单机毕竟一锤子买卖），不是网游要公平竞技加密到难以修改不是我的菜。
语言++：有中文有中文有中文！而且很全，教程和剧情都有，所以重要的事情说三遍。总体翻译质量还行，部分地方难以理解，不知道是翻译水平问题还是机翻问题。

Tras deslumbrar a muchos durante el E3 del año pasado, ya tenemos aquí Star Renegades, el nuevo título de Massive Damage, un notable vieojuego que combina con acierto los combates por turnos al más puro estilo JRPG, con las características clásicas de los roguelites. ¿El resultado? Una adictiva experiencia de la que cuesta soltar el mando.

La premisa con la que arranca el juego es bien simple, el robot J5T-1N llega a nuestro mundo desde una dimensión paralela para advertirnos de que la descomunal fuerza conocida como el Imperium planea conquistar nuestra realidad, algo que deberemos evitar a toda costa. ¿Pero y si fracasamos? No hay problema... J5T-1N viajará hasta otra realidad alternativa hasta que en alguna de ellas el Imperium sea derrotado.

A partir de aquí nos tocará enfrentarnos a los invasores a través de varios planetas en los que nos aguardarán toda clase de peligros y recompensas. El planteamiento del juego también es simple de entender. Comenzaremos siempre desde el mismo planeta con el objetivo de derrotar al general enemigo que lo controla, tarea para la cuál dispondremos de 3 días (una vez agotado el tiempo se nos transportará automáticamente al combate), mientras tanto podremos explorar a nuestro antojo, para derrotar enemigos y subir de nivel, encontrar cofres con recompensas o superar misiones secundarias que surgen de manera aleatoria.

La exploración se lleva a cabo desde una perspectiva aérea, como si fuesemos recorriendo el típico minimapa de los JRPG's de antaño y cada vez que pase un día deberemos descansar en nuestro campamento, en el cual podremos utilizar ciertas unas cartas que nos reportarán beneficios para el día siguiente, al mismo tiempo que nos reportarán grados de afecto con nuestro compañeros (según el personaje que la use y el que la reciba), dicho afecto servirá para desbloquear ataques en dúo muy poderosos, por lo que deberemos usar las cartas con cabeza, según lo que estemos buscando desbloquear.

Pero entrando ya en el verdadero plato fuerte de Star Renegades, sus combates por turnos, no puedo más que elogiar el trabajo de Massive Damage. Tenemos aquí unos combates muy divertidos y dinámicos, en los que podremos hacer diversos tipos de combos en base a las fortalezas o debilidades de los enemigos, por lo que al final también tienen un punto estratégico muy interesante. Actuar sin cabeza y a lo loco, puede llevarnos a una muerte inevitable, por lo que siempre hay que estar atentos para ver qué va mejor contra cada enemigo, pudiendo hacerles críticos, hacer que retrasen su turno de acción, añadirles penalizaciones etc. Y ya os advierto, es un juego bastante desafiante en este sentido, especialmente en los enfrentamientos contra jefes finales o subjefes que pueblan el mapa y custodian las mejores recompensas.

¿Pero qué pasa cuando somos derrotados? (algo que se va a dar con bastante frecuencia, sobre todo al principio) Pues lo primero es que si caemos contra algún enemigo especial, como un subjefe, éste va a ser ascendido y nos estará esperando la próxima vez con nuevas habilidades. Es una especie de sistema Némesis a lo Shadow of Mordor (aunque muchísimo más simple que aquel) y lo segundo, que perdemos todos los niveles que hubiésemos subido, todo el equipo obtenido y tocará empezar desde el principio. Aunque no todo son pérdidas, como buen roguelite, hay dos tipos de monedas que iremos acumulando durante las partidas que podremos usar al regresar a la base tras la derrota. Una nos servirá para desbloquear nuevos personajes para nuestro equipo y la otra para desbloquear objetos y ventajas para usar en partidas posteriores y así ir suavizando un poco las cosas.

Otro elemento muy importante de Star Renegades son los personajes, antes de embarcarnos de nuevo a la acción habrá que seleccionar a nuestro equipo (hasta un máximo de 6 al mismo tiempo) y esto será clave, pues cada uno de ellos tendrán su tipo de rol (DPS, Suport, Tank etc) y será vital ir con un grupo equilibrado, que se complemente.

Gráficamente el juego luce espectacular, con este diseño pixel absolutamente magnífico en todos los sentidos, mientras que la banda sonora tampoco está mal, aunque aquí sí que se echa en falta quizás algún tema más, por lo que a medio o largo plazo quizá nos empiece a aburrir un poco oírla, aunque bueno, no es nada grave.

[h1][b]Valoración final[/b][/h1]

Star Renegades es sin duda una excelente combinación de los combates por turnos de un JRPG con el género roguelite. Incluso aunque no os hagan especialmente gracia los roguelite, sus combates por turnos os ganarán por completo. Además es un juego bastante desafiante y adictivo, con muchos personajes controlables, variados enemigos y entornos y un diseño artístico sobresaliente.

The art and combat are incredible, the idea of ​​the progeny is good, the idea of ​​the camps and getting items, even if it is random, its... fine.
I think if it had been a JRPG it would have been very successful (but it would have been much more expensive to do so)
Level progress is buggy and outside of combat you depend on the randomness of what you find. You have a few characters, with whom you feel obliged to always make the same composition (getting new ones costs a lot and you unlock passives from characters you don't even have). You will die many times in a game that each run is about 5 hours, very very slow for a rogue lite. In addition, the improvements for each run to try to improve are practically null, you never notice any progression, there is no improvement tree or anything similar.

First of all good learning curve! Sounddesign and Pixel art a big unf! (So much detail!)

The game is more gamplayfocused, there is a story but mostly here for flair. (don't expect a Final Fantasy or Persona!)

It's slow to do anything. Clicking has to be exact and auto pathing doesn't exist, so you constantly have to click around stuff, which is frustrating in the cramped maps. Graphics SEEM exciting but then an hour or two in you realize they aren't.

Combat is just bleh. It's slow, easy, exploitable, and repetitive. I found myself just going through the motions for half the fights, but the designs of the fights purposely slow you down and make you check stuff so you can't make fights quick. So you just have a fight that you KNOW you're going to win with zero question about it, but you have to purposely take it slow. I had to purposely kill myself to even die and see the ""Roguelike"" mechanics because I figured I was done playing for the day (you might see my play time and say that's low, but I was halfway through the game, since it assumes you'll die a lot)... and Man those roguelite mechanics are bare bones at best.

Pros: 
Charming retro visuals and soundtrack!
In addition to the rogue-like element of having to restart a playthrough when your party wipes, there’s additional replayability in the form of the bosses and overlords
Interesting dialogue between characters that change gradually change as they become more fond of one another over the course of a playthrough
Intuitive turn-based combat with an emphasis on order of attack- Your attacks will automatically CRIT (dealing additional damage and often devastating effects) against enemies that you strike before they can hit you
Wide variety of characters and compositions that can make every playthrough feel different

Cons:
Despite the variety in characters as stated above, combat gives a serious edge to striking before your adversaries can attack. Spamming stuns and attacks that can stagger will allow your team to constantly crit, almost to the point of trivializing basic encounters and even some boss fights
The gameplay loop can be tiresome and the only thing that changes between worlds are the enemies and scenery. It would be great to see environmental effects or something similar that could provide strategic benefits or detriments depending on if you play around it!
Items and gear mainly give stat buffs or cause status effects, with little individuality even between the various weapon types. It’d be nice to see items that can change the role of a given character to spice up a run. 

Overall, I’m rather neutral in opinion towards Star Renegade. If you love rogue-likes, turn-based combat, or save-the-galaxy-from-impending-doom science fiction, It’s worth the 25$ price tag... but if you’re not a big fan of the genre then you might be a little disappointed.

I was obliterated by the third Behemoth (boss) this time.  Not sure how I'll beat him, but I figure more runs will upgrade my equipment and units enough to be able to do so.

This game feels like Slay the Spire in the Choose Your Own Adventure type way.  Combat feels more like Final Fantasy where you have a set of skills you go back and forth with the enemy and hope to come out on top.  The BREAK system (delaying opponent's turn) is useful, but right now I just end up pushing it to go before me next round, which isn't really better.  This may be something a character I unlock later can take advantage of.

The story is so far extremely simple - like Into the Breach.  The enemy is coming to destroy you, you fail, you time warp, and try again.  Doesn't really need to be more complicated than that.

The visual style is something I really love.  I don't know what the designer's infatuation with pink is, maybe their favorite Super Smash Brothers character is Kirby - but I am all for it.

Pros:
• Great visual style
• Fun and challenging strategy in combat
• Good replayability

Cons:
• Clunky UI/poor UX
• Map navigation, while novel, is tedious
• Combination of above two items makes for long run lengths


Overall I really enjoyed this game, it checks a lot of the boxes for what I like in a turn based strategy game. That's not to say that it doesn't have some issues, though.

[b]Run Time:[/b] My play speed for this type of game is generally on the slow side, so my first and only run so far ran about 12 hours including the post-run/between-run content to get set up for the second run. I would expect a run for someone familiar with the game mechanics to take about 4-6 hours. This is a [i]very long time[/i] for a roguelite game, there's no way around it. Some of that is offset by being able to save and quit out whenever you want, but the big draw of a roguelite for me is being able to do a run (or several) in one reasonable length gaming session. If map navigation and menu UX was streamlined, this would go a long way to bringing that time down.

[b]UI/UX:[/b] Having to manually navigate to each node's entrance on the map is cumbersome and slow. Automatic pathfinding or, better yet, the complete removal of animated movement across the map would make the whole experience more enjoyable.
Having the inventory buried beneath the squad menu and having to reopen the inventory each time you switch characters to check something is painful. There needs to be a more streamlined, single menu or dynamic menu where all of this information can easily be seen together. Some elements of the detail panes on the squad screen also get cut off and are not able to be fully viewed because they have pushed off the screen and the scroll wheel will change to another character instead of scrolling the information.
The combat UI has a number of issues that feel like they should have been ironed out during playtesting. It can often be challenging to select and view details about the correct unit without accidentally changing to a different unit because your mouse tracked over it. On the player's side, later in the game the list of abilities will start to block out the bottom of the effects list on some units, which isn't good if you don't know exactly what they've been hit with or buffed by. I also found myself having to manually check with an attack preview to see which enemies were in the front row vs the back row, when you would hope a good design would make this unambiguous.

I don't want to get too deep into minute details about what could be improved, but the overall feel is that the devs could have done some more playtesting to help polish the overall UX of the game, perhaps with a wider group that weren't too close to the project to miss things that might be taken for granted when you are familiar with all of the inner workings of the game. I hope they continue to support and improve upon the release build, because it really is a fun game when it comes down to it.",1599714167,1599714167,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005667285,156,6,753,0,753,1599710066,,

Took me 3 playthroughs and 18+ hours to clear the game for the first time and can't wait to run through it all over again.

Another point to make is that the game shows you that there are at least 13 unlockable characters and you can start a game with any of the 3 you have unlocked. This gives you 286 possible combinations you can run with! This isn't counting ones that can join you along the way or potential random events that pop up.

Fun part is there are plenty of ways to slice the cake and a lot more unlockable things I won't spoil here.

75729815,english,"Star Renegades is a Rogue-lite RPG with graphics based in pixels that focuses on team building and a very unique turn based combat system. You'll quickly find yourself immersed in the world and wanting more as your heroes level up, get to know one another and even have PROGENY! Will you survive this dimensional assault? Or will you be forced to hand off the torch to the next in a multiverse of stories and possibilities.

You're started off as the Pilot Wynn who according to the introduction video seems to have some type of backstory with the forces assaulting your dimension. Together with her comrade Davion she quickly escapes the initial decimation of their forces and regroups with him in the prologue of the story. From here the game does a wonderful job of walking you through controls and combat in the initial (and subsequent) battles. Explaining the timing of attacks, the crit system and how you can even BREAK an opponent's turn. 
 
The characters are witty and fleshed out. The system used to build friendships and relationships with your fellow adventurers is blended seamlessly with the story progression. You don't feel like you have to go out of your way to build them. Plus you get combat bonuses at the same time as you build your relations. Now while I personally didn't create any children of my own while playing (as of this writing) I did manage to get two characters to max relationship status which I assume will eventually allow me to do so. 

The music and the art of this game is wonderful. I'm brought back to the early era of gaming with simple tunes and old style pixel art with a modern twist on both. Which is nostalgic and refreshing at the same time. This acts as a perfect icing on top of the cake for a game that I was already excited to play as soon as I heard about it.
 
In conclusion, Massive Damage, Inc. did a wonderful job in creating this masterpiece of a game. I played about 6hrs of it in my first sitting and only got mid-way through the second world (out of 4). With that much packed in already and the fact that it’s a rogue-lite with infinite universes/heroes/enemies to go through you can expect hours upon hours of fun gameplay.

While this is a strength, it can also be a fault, the bosses of each planet(behemoths) are always the same so once you understand the strategy to beat them you can make your squad to handle them and breeze through them. I think it would be possible with the ""nemesis"" system to have more than one possible behemoth per planet so that your next squadmate choice would be more impactful.
There is also a giant lack of tooltips in the game, especially for equipment. Oh great, this gun inflicts ""Rattled"", but what is rattled? The only way to know is to use it in battle. So when you're faced with a choice of three items with different effects you don't know, you can't make an informed decision. You have to make do and learn the status effects by using them in combat, which shouldn't be so bad normally but there are just so many of them that it does become a problem. It is especially problematic because equipment can be very strong, so strong in fact that it almost feels like it's more important to level up to equip gear than to unlock a new card/skill.

My main problem with the game is it doesn't respect your time at all, through a unintuitive UI that takes a ridiculous amount of clicks to move through to see all the information available (who's attacking who and for how much with what status effects) (Into the breach and Monster Train have similar deterministic combat but present  themselves with much more clarity), the UI frequently blocks its self when you have more then 2 enemies on the screen, the moving around the map and looking at your options takes a long time compared to other similar games (StS, Monster Train, FTL) where all the information is presented neatly on one screen including your options.  Having to walk around the map takes time for no reason i can see, (not to mention having to walk back through areas to pick up that 1 DNA that spawned before you camp) why the hell do I have to take 30 seconds to look for it and then walk to it?  The pointless screens that slow down pacing the one that bothered me the most was the level up screen which tells you the same information you just selected but flashier, and all the pointless chatter from your people and the enemies that just slows the game down.

I don't like the equipment but I'm having trouble putting why into words seems both very impactful and not impactful at the same time and it takes so much time to manage effectively.

Writing is quite bad.

There is a ton of wasted real estate in the Throne room or maybe i haven't gotten to that content yet feels like planned content that isn't released yet.

Ultimately it feels like a new UI and a few other cuts/improvements runs would take 1/2 the time.

75719178,english,"First off, let's confirm what we've seen in all the preview material leading up to the release: the visual style is fantastic, and the core combat gameplay is innovative and challenging. 

I've been looking forward to this game for some time now, and I finally got my hands on it. After a few runs, it's apparent to me that a lot of work was put into the visual presentation and combat mechanics. The sprites and quasi-3D settings are stunning and feel like they just ""fit"" the ethos of the game, and the combat can be a real treat for strategy lovers. That said, other aspects of the game feel out of place.

Overall the user experience is less than optimal. The menu systems for everything from choosing which powers to throw at the enemy to equipping items are clunky and unintuitive.

Traversing the world with the point and click controls is a nice novelty, but in practice is frustrating due to the slow pace at which your party moves and the lack of pathfinding (your party will follow a straight line and get stuck if something is in the way). In all honesty, I would have preferred a branching path on a map (a la Into the Breach). This current system feels like an obstacle to the core gameplay more than a feature.

Character progression is another miss in my opinion. The game could have benefitted from a choice-based progression system, where the player can select which abilities/traits to level into as they make it deeper into a run. By the end of a run your characters are always pretty much the same, and have accumulated a bunch of abilities that you're no longer using, exacerbating the clunky menu system.

The loot system, where properties are rolled at random in the Diablo style, also feels out of place. Gameplay would be better balanced and more consistent if we had access to a random assortment from a finite item pool. As it stands, I found myself thinking very little about which items to use, since you don't end up finding that many relative the number of item slots in your final 5-man party.

Runs are also too long for the game format. It took me upwards of 6 and a half hours to make it to the end of the final planet. I think the developers intended for us to save, quit and resume the game throughout a run, but this sadly does not feel right given the roguelike nature of the game, and the ephemerality of all your progress once a run is over. In my opinion, a Darkest Dungeon style system, where the player can assemble a party from a subset of their characters and set off on shorter individual missions would have been of great benefit to the pacing of this game.

The combat UI, while innovative and mostly great, has some glaring defects that make the game feel unfinished. I know it is mentioned in a tutorial bubble, and I also recognize the inherent difficulty in designing an interface for such a complex system, but the damage previews not reflecting any kind of damage mitigation the player has selected feels like it's a sorely missing v1 feature. Enemies that deal damage at random is also a poorly designed system, since it's virtually indistinguishable from an attack that is attacking all party members. I very often felt as though I couldn't reliably predict what kind of damage my party would take once a turn was over, which is clearly not what you would expect in a game where you plan all your moves on a timeline.

75716662,english,"This game is what happens when designers don't know the difference between game design that is satisfyingly difficult, and designers that think that simply because the game is hard, it will be enjoyable.

The primary wrinkle in this game's combat system is that your attacks won't miss and whether or not you crit is based on whether or not you strike first. If you stagger them enough, you can prevent them from attacking for the round. Enemies also have an attack counter on them, and if you exhaust that counter, the enemy cannot be staggered any further. Hitting enemies in their weaknesses inflicts slightly greater amounts of stagger on them, but it's not exceptionally meaningful.

Where this all falls apart is once the game starts trying to add complexity on top of complexity. Once they start introducing formations and auto-counterattacks and auto-guards, the game just gets stupidly dumb. Nobody wants to play an RPG where ""victory through attrition"" is the most effective strategy. In theory, the game's choices are there to offer you a wealth of tactical options, but in practice, it's either, ""Does my entire team defend this round, or do we attack this round?"" It all shakes out this way because, for the most part, you can't heal in battle. You don't have items that you can use to heal mid-fight. 

Guarding and counters are another annoyance. You'll have guys standing BEHIND a front line unit, guarding literally every attack that you hit them with. (Because THAT makes strategic sense, somehow.) You can't stagger a unit that's guarding, because guard happens at Init 0. So, for 2 different enemy units, the game's core systems are functionally ignored. The target has no choice but to defend (because all buffs I've seen so far, simply expire after one turn, and once again, you can't heal characters mid-fight) and in situations where the attacking character being guarded is throwing out an AoE attack, you just have to sit back and defend with the entire team. Same thing happens when one character takes up overwatch. Either EVERY character making an attack gets lit up that turn, in addition to taking the damage that the enemy is gonna dish out, or just defend with the entire team. You will choose full defense FAR, FAR more often in this game than any other RPG out there. I just went through Persona 5 Royal on Hard, and I have already defended more in my first 2 runs on this game than I did in the entirety of the 110+ hours of P5R. That is not a metric you should be striving for, especially when your game's version of defense is basically just ""sit there and eat less damage.""

Formations in this game seem to be broken. I've had several instances where the only thing in front of a unit I want to attack is a corpse, but my character won't attack them. Other characters doing the same type of attack will be able to attack that unit, but not the one I actually want to attack that unit. 

And if something in here seems to be entirely different to your experience with the game, you can chalk that up to the game's worst flaw, one of the worst UIs I've ever seen in a video game. You travel along on a map by clicking your mouse on where to go. But because you can only get into a certain number of fights a day (also a gripe I have) I guess they want you to make really, really sure that you want to go from point A to point B before you use up a breach point you didn't intend to. Well, then let me move freely to all points that DON'T need a breach point! Also, why do you require me to walk my characters into the middle of a section to pick up a reward? It just becomes a stupid exercise in trigger spot hunting to move from section to section at night. The UI in combat is even worse, though. It's partially because of the graphic-style of ""barfing good art through a pseudo-16-bit rasterizer"" but it's primarily that all pertinent information in combat is displayed in the least helpful manner. Attacks targeting your units will be displayed as a series of arrow lines leading from the attacker to the target. Your arrows and the enemy arrows are all the same color. If one of your units and one of the enemy units are attacking multiple targets, good luck figuring what the hell the other 6 units on the board are targeting.

I cannot recommend purchasing this. One of the most regretted purchases of 2020 for me. 3.5/10.",1599684032,1599684120,False,22,1,0.625557601451873779,1,True,False,False,76561197993297764,136,2,1226,0,841,1599716592,,
75715110,english,"Game plays like it's in EA, but it's a ""Full release"".

The animated trailer has nothing to do with the game, so keep that in mind going in.

The game is about 2-4 hours long, depending on your skill. You can easily beat the game on your first run if you just play smartly. There's no real ""rogue"" elements outside of slightly randomized gear (But the gear seems to always be something usable by your party and almost always is an upgrade every time you open a chest. There's never any ""bad"" chests or real luck-based elements which can be a plus for some but also means it's much less random than they'd like you to think.

Much of the game is recycled by the time you get to the second planet. Enemies are bland and there's not many types of them. I've more or less memorized all of the enemy types and how to counter them with just about any setup of characters after my first run, because taking a quick glance at some of the characters you can see how much overlap there is between them.

That isn't to say all the characters are ""balanced"". There are some who are free win machines (COUGH COUGH, Aegis COUGH COUGH.) that can carry a party through the whole game if you aren't terrible at having common sense.

There are numerous typos, glitches, floating pixels from PNG's not being imported properly, and many MANY more bugs. I recently found one that lets you walk through walls. You can also just be screwed by the game with it locking gear crates behind areas you physically cannot reach, meaning you simply do not get that chest no matter how well you play. There are limits to how many areas you can move between in the ""World map"" and if an area has ""lockdown imminent"" status, and is more than 3 spaces away from you on spawn, that space on the map is locked off forever. Period. It's like it doesn't exist.

So my question is...why have this mechanic of locking off the entirety of the map by the end of the 3 day period if the idea is supposed to be for you to explore and level up? I'm usually locked into an empty section of the map by day 2 and just spend day 3 getting more free buffs from camping.

The story is nonexistent, there's practically no story based content. This review is already two or three times longer than all the ""story"" based dialogue in the game, I'm not even kidding.

The problem is that there's nothing original here. It's all mechanics and systems lifted from other games and implemented in the most base and face value way without even considering what those mechanics reason for being is.

The nemesis system was implemented to be a long term thing, a game of cat and mouse where you slowly learn more about enemies and how to take them down, and taking them down gave you rewards or other benefits. 

Now, the ""Nemesis"" enemies are just a mixture of normal enemies and one boss which has been the same bosses every time I've played thus far, with the same weaknesses and the same strengths, meaning it's the same strategy to beat each of them....every time...meaning using characters outside the ones that counter said enemies can cause you to get ""blocked"".

Some of the cast is vastly less useful for trying to win a run. Fun to play with, sure. But not for actually winning runs...And what changes when you beat the game for the first time?

You get to do it again without the main character being available, and being replaced with a slightly better version of her.  That's your reward for sitting through the slog of middle-school level ""memes"".

Characters are obsessed with getting high off of frogs, shrooms and crystals, and one stinks like garbage so bad that the main character gets horny over it. I'm not even kidding.

This is an alright game, my rating for it is something between thumbs up and a thumbs down. I'm just going to list 3 main reasons why I couldn't keep playing and had to refund the game.

1. Paper thin writing (characters, dialogue, plot) which I suppose is normal for this type of game.
2. Linear gameplay (exploration, combat) , you're really just trying to attack before the enemy does most of the time.
3. Amateurish character art/design. Not only are the characters literally boring, they are also visually boring.",1599681293,1599681497,False,4,0,0.427850544452667236,0,True,False,False,76561198218311713,45,6,53,0,53,1599680291,,
75666557,english,"This was one of my most anticipated games for this autumn, my first impressions are:

Positives:

- Visuals are stunning (love it!)
- Combat is deep and challenging
- Writing is funny and filled with eastern eggs (loved the cantina!)
- Character progression and unlocks are interesting
- Roguelite elements are well thought
- Soundtrack is decent and fits the theme

Negatives:

-Combat can feel a bit repetitive, especially at start before you unlock new skills
-Slow pace for a roguelite, so expect longer gameplay loops
-JRPG style world map feels pointless and is difficult to navigate at times
-Could use some quality of life upgrades, like skipping a turn with a hotkey
-There are some unnecessary timesinks like backtracking in map at night
-UI is terrible
-Did I mention the UI is terrible? This is my main issue with otherwise solid game. Some examples:

1. If you want to fully enjoy the tactical deep combat system you have to inspect enemy weaknesses and strengths. The UI makes this so tedious and complicated I just couldn't bother. To inspect enemies you need to hold Z (or right click) first to launch inspection mode, then hold X to see their weaknesses. 

Simple hover or right click to show all information at once would be a lot better solution.

2. Combat menus are old school and that's fine as a design choice, but some symbols are small and hovering over them doesn't bring up any tooltips. You can't see HP by numbers (unless you inspect), only small bars on the lower left corner.

3. UI has flashing elements that are really distracting. For example the skill you hover over in combat and HP gains in level up screen. This game has a lot going on visually and making the UI flash some elements distracts a lot.

4. Some buttons are clickable with mouse, others are not (like exit button in camp, you actually have to press backspace to exit)



The gameplay is great but unfortunately I can't recommend Star Renegades at this price for now. It needs some serious UI polishing and quality of life upgrades.

75711610,english,"No RNG during battles! 

That is not to say things are easy or simple. Once you get a full roster of characters in your squad and you face multiple enemies, there are plenty of meaningful choices to make every round. Some opponents looked so tough that I thought they would wipe the floor with my squad, yet I prevailed by making decent tactical decisions. Had I lost, I would have blamed myself, not the RNG gods.

The combination of shields, armor and health means that there are many ways to mitigate and manage incoming damage. 

Unlike many other games, ""defense"" is a viable and useful action to take, in context. Tough enemy about to wipe out your squad with a powerful AOE attack? Defense may actually allow you to live another round, just enough to make a comeback in the next round.

The break and crit system (basically pushing back enemy attacks to the next round and unleashing extra damage/effects, respectively) provides a lot of opportunities for various strategies. Quick light attacks that push back on the enemy attack timers are absolutely necessary before you can efficiently unleash heavy attacks (or avoid taking too much damage yourself).

Different types of damage and vulnerabilities also mean that you need a balanced squad to make it through. Some enemies get enraged when hit with certain types of attacks. This makes them more dangerous (+damage), but also more vulnerable (they also receive +damage). 

As you camp and your squad develops relationships through the bestowing of cards/effects that will help in upcoming battles, they eventually unlock useful bonuses and combo attacks. 

Great graphics. Yes it's pixelated, but there is a lot of attention to details, style and animations. 

Great music that fits the sci-fi theme.

As others have pointed out, the UI could use a couple of improvements. Some mechanics remained a bit obscure until after I experimented a bit (all the while surviving my initial playthrough of the first planet). Three hours in, I now feel quite comfortable.

Some characters seem a little strong in comparison with others from my experience, could use some tweaking, but every character has it's own purpose in a party (note: I have not unlocked all the characters at the time of writing this review)

The only major CONs for this game are the interface and tooltips.
INTERFACE
1. It just feels clunky. Switching between ""Inspection"" and ""Battle"" mode is tedious. I have had multiple situations, where I wanted to read up on an attack the enemy is doing and go into Inspection mode(which can be done by right clicking the unit) but had trouble getting out of it, even when pressing the Exit button in the top right corner.
2. Why not show the damage numbers over the head of the enemies, where the attack name is? Would save a lot of clicking back and forth.
3. It also happened to me, that i could not target one of my units, because it was halfway obscured by the interface and everytime i tried to target it, it counted as clicking on the interface. 
4. I don't see the point of the enemy shield and health bars in the bottom right corner, if they don't show their actual HP numbers for quick reference, because I have to inspect them anyway to get the information needed for calculation.
There is more, but I feel this would get out of hand.

TOOLTIPS
I feel nowadays it is the required development standard to have tooltips on hover for Keywords such as ""Rattled"" ""Irradiated"" etc. Having the Keywords unexplained in Shops and Reward choices (they are explained if you HAVE the Item) is a big NO in todays gaming industry. Also Burn and Bleed tell you, that they do damage, but not how much...

75684374,english,"I'll be looking at this game from the perspective of an SRPG vet, including Fire Emblem, DD, XCOM, etc.

-VISUALS-

This game is a treat.
There really is no other way to say it, I'm not sure pixel art and pixel art animation has ever been done better. The subtle 3D effects on certain aspects just makes it all the better. The environments, both out of battle and in it, are stunning every time. The animations are overall very pleasant with some nice weight accentuated by the screen shake and camera movement.

Really no complaints here at all, there's even a speed up option by holding down space a la Monster Train.

-STORY/LORE-

It's fine, for what it is. Vague, and doesn't go too far, but certainly helps frame it and is interesting enough. Writing is fine, lots of one liners which may or may not land depending on your humor. I found them overall cheesy enough to laugh at the tongue-in-cheek nature of them, but it certainly won't be for everyone. Overall most likely the weakest aspect of the game.

-GAMEPLAY AND LOOP-

The real meat and potatoes. Star Renegade uses a timeline system, wherein you can manipulate enemy turns (up to a limit) in order to force them further and further back. The system itself is well implemented and easy to grasp thanks to a solid tutorial. If I had any complaints, it's honestly that the system is far too easily abusable depending on the composition. Balance will never be perfect in games like these, the Vestal is still a thing in Darkest Dungeon, but on my 2nd run ever I was able to lock the final boss of the game for about 8 turns in a row thanks to a combination of stuns (which are admittedly infrequent) and delays.

I'm not sure there's an easy fix, and there are 2 harder difficulties that I will be exploring which may crank up enemy stats enough to where this isn't as big of a deal, however unless the time delays are tuned in higher difficulties I doubt this will be the case as otherwise it is just raw stats. (NOTE: I wrote in an edit down below but the higher difficulties can and will kick your teeth in, this is not an easy game by any means. Do not be fooled by your first few runs.)

Being able to choose starting party composition (3/5 of your final squad) is a really nice boon, it keeps some randomness while allowing experimentation. I have not unlocked all characters at the time of writing (some require extensive relationship building, of which I've done one and am satisfied with both the system and the resulting character). The camping portion where this build up happens feels intuitive and easy to grasp, once again very Darkest Dungeon-esque with limited ""points"" to spend on skills. While the balance is very questionable for some of these, the overall impact was enjoyable and weighing building bonds for better passive bonuses vs. immediate camping buffs was the most enjoyable aspect.

Enemy design, visually, is incredible and the fights themselves are fun as well. Some fights are very much out of the power curve balance wise (2nd planet final boss comes to mind as a major spike that is hard to deal with, whereas the final boss just isn't enough of a threat when you bring certain strategies that I will withhold from this review to let you figure out that on your own). Overall a good time, nothing especially annoying, although enemies do tend to behave in a very similar way. Part of the learning curve for other games is prioritizing certain enemies who buff others, or debilitate you, and there is not nearly as much of that going on. Focus firing is still good, but who you focus fire more often than I would like comes down to ""he hits harder so I hit him first"".

Items are also mostly just okay, nothing really intriguing here but nothing offensive either. I would really enjoy seeing more specialized items that retool a character in some way, maybe towards the end showing items that are character specific that alter playstyles. Hero perks do this already somewhat, but mostly just reinforce what the character is already good at. Having an item radically alter a support class to be damage oriented in a drastic way would really help spice up runs.

-MUSIC-

I've seen some complaints about the music and I simply cannot agree, while I don't think it's a stand out in the way Darkest Dungeon is, the music is nonetheless excellent at setting the tone and does not get repetitive. Certainly not the best the genre has to offer but by no means the worst, and won't make you want to turn it off as I regularly have in many other games after some time.

-CONCLUSION-

Overall, even as a veteran of the genre, I think Star Renegades separates itself through a combination of visuals that are unique and striking, along with gameplay that has a good bit of depth to it. The ability to freely mix and match the majority of your party is a huge boon to making repeat runs interesting. Every character I've played with has been fun in their own way, and figuring out what characters synergize well is as always a joy in games like this. There are some notable flaws, namely in balancing variety of items/monsters, but those are long term, 50-100+ hour problems, not ones that will grate on you for your first, fifth, or tenth playthrough.

If you've read all this, thank you! I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do. I'll certainly be playing more and will edit my review accordingly if anything major changes.

[b] Summary: [/b]  

Star Renegades made me struggle with finding something to put in the negatives column of this review, and if that isn't an endorsement from the get go, I'm not exactly sure why you're looking at this review in the first place. While the game has definitely taken influence from several big names in the genre like Darkest Dungeon and Fire Emblem, it does it in its own way: combining them in a synergy to present a challenge to the player WITHOUT  making any one system feel like it's there for the sake of being there. The funny thing however is that while those systems will remind you of other games in the genre, you'll sit there wondering why this game feels so DIFFERENT from everything else in the genre you've played recently: and that's Star Renegades strength. It's ability to feel fresh while familiar at the same time. 

The combat system relying on breaking the opponent and first attacks, while still putting emphasis on health and strategy, is the shining star of the game, as even the smallest of battles will make you pay attention to minimize health and armor risk without feeling like the game is overly difficult. Don't get me wrong though: the game can punish big mistakes and you will need a few runs under your belt  before you really get to try to actually complete a run, but the roguelite system present feels like it helps you just enough on consecutive runs without  feeling like it's pulling down the difficulty too much. Character combinations and the affection system work well to reward smart camping, and paying attention to the nemesis system and how you can set yourself up for success will make you feel like a genesis when a plan comes together.

But beyond that,  a striking presentation relying on animation and key elements to latch on to in the visuals will make you discard the “just another pixel art game” in the genre. Character portraits have life to them and make them feel in that “cartoony yet realistic” valley, and combat animations have weight with smart sound design and reasonable death animations that emphasize the action at hand. Don't overlook the typical sci-fi story here either: it's use of genre tropes and jokes make you pay attention to it, while making you care about the characters that you're trying to protect. 

Like I said at the start of this review, I'm sitting here and struggling with trying to find an element that really doesn't work in the game and maybe it'll come in time. But as first impressions go, Star Renegades not only made a lasting impact: it did it with its own style, and is well worth digging in on Xbox Game Pass or Steam.

[*] Smartly designed combat system that focuses on breaking enemies (making them lose their turn) and strategy more then a lot of games in the genre can say.
[*] Strategy is at the forefront here and more then anything else in the genre, this game doesn't feel like a numbers game. Numbers help, but the game most definitely makes you work for victories. 
[*] Camping system enhances the affection system while giving you tools to work and plan out your next move in smart ways.
[*] Hard decisions to make with equipment and strategy makes concurrent runs interesting as you'll want to see what strategies you can come up with.
[*] Difficult without just throwing the kitchen sink at you. Makes you pay attention to small encounters without feeling like it's oppressive.
[*] Sound design enhances information passing to make you feel the impact of killing an enemy or making the wrong decision. 
[*] Characters are fun yet also relatable: making you want to unlock more of them to see where their arcs go.
[*] Strong focus on animation and detail gives the world life, pushing it past its pixel art limits. Great designs none the less.
[*] Game's writing and its sense of humor rivals some of the best in the genre even after only a few hours, and had me snickering and smiling many times during my first hours. 
[*] Music doesn't get in the way but also provides tunes that in many aspects help you think.

Some of the portraits feel a bit hit or miss at the start, but once you get used to it the aesthetic is really enjoyable. The smaller battle sprites are fantastic quality from the start.

Little bit of a nemesis system in there, where enemies from previous runs can be ""promoted"" into later ""floors"" on subsequent runs. Were you doing a sidequest and got wiped by a shield draining enemy? Well, looks like they've been put in charge of defending a planet, so now you gotta consider how you will overcome this enemy that beat you before in your next run.

I'm still early but the variety in units feels good so far. I'm excited to try out the different combinations, and so far I haven't run into a ""bad"" unit. All of them feel like they bring something worthwhile to the table.

Combat is based on perfect info. Before picking your moves, you are told what your opponents are doing and who they're targeting, and it's up to you to manipulate the turn order in such a way so as to maximise performance. Very enjoyable approach.

The tone of the writing is pretty lighthearted, which doesn't really jive for me considering the war setting and my units literally having the flesh torn from their bones by space-time rifts. You get used to it as you play, it's just a bit ""meh"" when starting out.

I don't like the ""NPC"" civilians on some maps, that you can hover over to read info. Most their writing doesn't feel like it contributes anything.

The map choices matter, and that 1-2 DNA drops gave me the chance to equip a nice piece of gear just before an elite fight, or the boss. Also later worlds are a lot tougher, and ""good"" tactics make a ton of difference. A couple of camp buffs can turn a fight. At least this is my experience so far.

75669607,english,"It's alright, but nothing special. The artwork and animations are great—minus some of the portraits, like the main character with her mouth open. The music gets tiresome pretty quick; it's like a droning hum that you tune out, instead of having moments that get you pumped, or establish the atmosphere.

The writing sucks. The attempts at humor aren't funny. The worldbuilding is poor, with little payoff for the lore. You're told about elements of the world and story, without ever actually encountering or interacting with those elements of the world. You just end up not caring about any of it because it has no bearing on anything. The character interactions are shallow, none of the characters are interesting, and they don't do anything interesting to each other. These may seem like unimportant points, but the characters talk a lot, and the description on the store page says ""forge bonds between heroes"". It's hard to care about any of these characters. Plus, there are errors in basic English grammar, showing a lack of attention to this aspect of the game, and a lack of writing experience by whoever wrote the dialogue. Among these careless mistakes are using the plural form of a word when they meant to use the possessive form (eg. “my friends name is John""), and capitalizing a word that isn’t a proper noun, after a comma (eg. ""hey what’s up, My name is John"").

The overworlds aren’t interesting. You’re never rewarded for exploring or looking around, you just have to click the visibly relevant parts, so 90% of the empty space is pointless. When night rolls around, some nearly-insignificant amounts of currency will spawn on the overworld. You can backtrack to pick these up. There’s nothing fun or interesting about that. There are also some lore points and NPC dialogue to read, but, as mentioned, these are poorly executed. I don’t care about the agricultural techniques of the Zugwops of the Blorglorpulon sector if you’re never going to make them relevant to the game or story.

The selling point is the gameplay, which is alright, but it lacks the depth of the games from which it draws inspiration (games like Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon). You aren't making that many interesting decisions, and some characters (like the archon robot that does AoE and can shield allies) seem to have such lackluster abilities that you want to just skip some of their turns so that they don't trigger small turn delays on enemies instead of big ones. There don't seem to be terribly many interesting abilities, just different amounts of damage and turn delay. The status effects I've seen that you can inflict (like armor corrosion and tiny DoT effects) have been nearly insignificant. A lot of enemies also just do generic damage. That's their threat—they're going to do damage to you. There are usually more interesting enemy interactions going on in games like these, like enemies buffing each other, or charging up for a big attack, or stunning, or disrupting you in other ways.

The game tells you that delaying enemy turns is powerful, and it is... but only near the end of an enemy's life. Delaying an enemy's turn only really matters when you deny them a turn and then kill them before they act, otherwise they just do that same attack at a later time, where it'll do more damage and other effects by critting you! Crits happen when the attacker hits the defender before the defender acts. If you use a low-damage attack that delays an enemy's turn enough to make them lose an action this turn, that enemy will likely act before any of your characters on the following turn, critting someone. You have to delay their turn enough that you can actually act before them on the following turn, and make sure that your actions on the following turn will kill them. The turn delay stuff ends up not mattering a decent bit of the time, because some enemies have enough HP that you just have to do raw damage to them until denying them actions matters (ie when they're near death). This makes delaying boss turns not terribly impactful, since they live so long. Delaying boss attacks enough that you get crits you otherwise wouldn't is useful, but if you're not careful, the boss will just act before you on the following turn and crit you unavoidably, while preventing all of your characters from critting.

Despite being billed as a deterministic game, the enemy intents are nowhere near as clear as they are in Slay the Spire. There are too many examples of this to list, but one is the first Behemoth boss’s AoE attack, Bullet Hell. The attack preview told me that the attack was targeting all my units for 284 damage. All of them were going to die from this attack (2/3 of my units didn’t even have this much max HP+shields!), and the preview predicted the death of my entire party. Once the attack came, the 284 damage was split between my three units, and none of them died. Why does the preview trick you into thinking everyone is going to take 284 damage? And if this is a deterministic game, why have a random attack, instead of splitting the damage predictably?

The UI can be confusing, too. The game doesn’t tell you which unit is going to act first when two units are acting at the same point in the timeline. Attack order matters a lot for things like crits (am I critting the enemy, or are they critting me?) and maximizing the amount by which you delay enemy turns (is my big delay attack going to hit first, or my small delay attack? The small delay attack can hit first and trigger the enemy's immunity to further turn delay, wasting the big delay attack).

The equipment choices that I’ve seen, even at epic chests, aren’t very interesting. The effects tended to be minor and not gameplay-altering. The same goes for the Darkest Dungeon-inspired camp buffs. Besides the heals (which seem to be the only way to restore health) their combat effects were not very impactful. -25% corrosive damage taken for the next 2 fights? What even does that kind of damage? Am I going to encounter that kind of damage in the next 2 fights? Is -25% really going to make that big of a difference when the enemy doesn’t even do that type of damage every turn?",1599603491,1599621978,False,149,7,0.679626524448394775,0,True,False,False,76561197992829159,665,62,163,0,162,1599614937,1599664736.0,"Hi Vizer, thanks for your feedback.

但我仍然可以说这是今年给我惊喜最大的独立游戏:

1、官中
2、有特色的像素画风以及色调，霓虹味拉满
3、少见的回合制肉鸽，战斗系统有一定的深度跟研究价值
4、队友间的好感培养，甚至还能生仔
5、随机的地图以及精英怪巨兽，并且有类似中土世界的宿敌系统，怪物击败主角能得到晋升
6、音乐很带感
7、部分对话很有意思

————————————————

当然短暂体验下肯定还是有些别的问题，但瑕不掩瑜:

1、单张地图无法探完，无法走回头路，对强迫症不友好
2、感觉bgm是单曲循环（或者差异太小我没有分辨），应该根据不同的怪物难度以及地图，来更换不同风格的bgm
3、露营的时候使用不同卡牌跟队友增进感情时，演示过于简单，只有好感+2+3，可以适当插入一些像素动作跟动画
4、无配音，最起码一些常用语跟遇怪时的骚话，应该加入配音
5、用鼠标控制人物移动会出现白色的虚线路径线，感觉没有必要，反而充满了违和感
6、翻译有些机翻的生硬感

————————————————

后期希望见到的更新:

1、既然有了宿敌系统，为什么不能把可爱的机械兽抓回基地培养跟圈养呢~
2、更多的角色以及背景扩充
3、更多的势力纠葛
4、在保留风格的前提下，更多的地图组件模块

75677621,english,"Fair Warning : I'm playing this on release day prior to any patches.

The Bad
 There are a few bugs and unintentional spelling errors though. There are also a few frame rate issues that don't make sense (2080super + 9900k @ 5). When you want to transfer between ""rooms"" your dude goes in a straight line and gets stuck. Some of the indicators for ""click here to go between rooms"" are either really faint or just plain not there, that being said I never had a problem getting to the next room. Sometimes I just had to float my mouse around a bit to find the entrance. All that being said, this is minor stuff that didn't impact my enjoyment of the game and could be patched relatively easily.

The Good 
Basically everything. The renegades that I've played (all save four I think) all have their place and feel valuable even if I picked a garbage party comp in the beginning. I never got frustrated or felt that I was ""cheap shot"". When I took a beating or lost it was my own fault. There is a lot of depth here between remembering what buffs/debuffs are active, what abilities enemies have inherently, and the items you get that can totally alter a characters playstyle (say favoring light attacks over heavy for a debuff).

The visuals are beautiful, the depth they create by having a 3d scene with flat pixel art is awesome. The lighting effects are really cool and the game also has a great sense of humor. 

I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the ""go as far as you can, die, learn, upgrade, repeat"" kind of games. There is a lot to be had here and the bugs/issues I ran into didn't ruin anything for me.

+The game has a lot of cheeky humor, dotted with some tense and serious bits, though these are mostly overshadowed by the previous humor. 


-Maneuvering in the overworld is a bit of a pain, since you have to click on a specific spot to move to the next zone (each overworld map has many zones you enter for loot, battles, etc), and you have to do this even after you've cleared the zone.
-Sometimes getting the UI to work the way you want is a hassle, mostly due to the way sprites are.

So sehr ich auch das komplexe und taktische Runden-Kampfsystem von Star Renegades zu schätzen weiß, so sehr nervt mich der Rogue-lite-Krempel, welcher das Spiel meines Erachtens nur zäh werden lässt, statt diesem den angepeilten Mehrwert mit auf den Weg zu geben. Ich sage ja nicht, dass Rogue-lite-Elemente überhaupt nicht funktionieren können, aber gerade in Star Renegades wird der tatsächliche Spielfortschritt derart knausrig gehandhabt, dass die Motivation des Spielers sehr stark darunter zu leiden hat. Glücklicherweise gelingt es dem coolen Kampfsystem mich zumindest teilweise wieder zu versöhnen. Und auch die grafische Darstellung, welche ihre Inspiration aus Octopath Traveler bezieht weiß zu gefallen. Apropos Inspirationsquellen: Die Entwickler von Star Renegades bedienen sich ganz schön stark aus anderen Produkten. Der Grafikstil stammt aus Octopath Traveler, die Idee JRPG-Kämpfe einer taktischen Evolution zu unterziehen gabs bereits in Cosmic Star Heroine und die Story, sowie das grobe Konzept der Mech-Rüstungen entstammt dem Sci-fi-Film Edge of Tomorrow. Hey, ich sage nicht, dass es falsch ist sich inspirieren zu lassen, oder sogar gewisse Dinge direkt zu entnehmen, aber ein bisschen arg auffällig ist die Herangehensweise der Entwickler dann doch.
Dennoch sehe ich sehr viel Potential im kanadischen Indie-Entwickler Massive Damage, Inc. Wir brauchen mehr Spiele mit derartigen Kampfsystemen! Daher auch die positive Wertung mit zugekniffenen Auge (ich bin ja auch kein Rogue-lite/like Fan).


Pro und Kontra:

Pro:
- coole Rundenkämpfe im JRPG-Stil welche angenehm taktisch und knifflig gehalten sind
- sehr schöner Grafikstil
- bietet eine sehr solide Palette unterschiedlicher Spielfiguren

Kontra:
- die Rogue-lite-Elemente sorgen auf Dauer natürlich für eine gewisse Repetition und viel Frust
- belangloser OST
- Story, Sagengut und zum Teil auch die Charaktere wirken nur wie Beiwerk

Для кого подойдет игра?
Как мне кажется, она зайдет абсолютно всем людям которые неравнодушны к инди проектам с пиксельной графикой.
В игре переплетаются несколько игровых жанров и механик присущих таким направлениям как РПГ, Рогалик, Стратегия, Визуальная новелла и прочее.
Ближе всего игра находится к JRPG времен PS1 и таким играм как Final Fantasy, Breatch of Fire  и серии игр Хроно.

Здесь вам и карта мира с бегающими друг за другом персонажами, меню прокачки и экипировки, меню способностей, а так же полюбившаяся многими игроками ""комната с тактическими боями"".
Из того что я увидел мне понравилось все, словил флешбеки из детства и пустил скупую мужскую слезу вспоминая долгие посиделки у экрана телевизора, поэтому оценю на 10 из 10 возможных.
( Возможно после полного прохождения изменю некоторые детали ).

В визуальном плане игра очень хорошо проработана, несмотря на простенькую пиксельную графику и анимацию разработчик умудрился ""апнуть"" ее уровень и слепить что-то свое.
И скажу я вам у него получилось.
Цвета в игре не едкие, карта трехмерна, присутствует множество мелких анимированных деталей и предметов, что делает окружение более насыщенным и уникальным.
Нареканий к этой части игры нет.

Что касается саундтрека... Могу вас порадовать, он здесь шикарен.
Напоминает музыку из фильмов про будущее снятых в далеких 90-х.
(Те кто смотрел недавний короткометражный фильм  ""Кровь машин""  и оказался в восторге от музыки в фильме будут довольны.)
Описать я это не могу, лучше один раз услышать чем читать об этом.
Расписывать каждую механику я не буду, для этого есть гайды и видеообзоры на просторах сети, тем кому интересен проект не составит труда покопаться в интернете.
От себя скажу лишь то, что игра прекрасна.
Да, я люблю ""ретро-игры""с механиками JRPG и готов покупать их каждый раз когда они предлагают мне что-то новое, оригинальное и необычное, бросают некий вызов заезженным до дыр проектам.
Мне нравится играть в игры которые были созданы благодаря тщательной проработке сюжета, лора, персонажей и прочего.
Игры сделанные с душой.
В Star Renegades присутствует все вышеперечисленное.
Если вы ищите игру чтобы отдохнуть вечерком, но при этом хотите потратить время за чем-то интересным то это творение вам подходит по всем параметрам.

Инди, пиксель, JRPG, фантастика, тактические бои, прекрасный саундтрек, мультимикс из жанров и внимание к деталям - это все сильные стороны игры.
Слабых пока не выявлено.

[h1] Written Review [/h1]
Star Renegades has a great core combat system, with a variety of characters to spice up your runs.

The game is turn-based, and at the beginning of every round, you can see all your enemies' actions laid out on a timeline. Different attacks have different speeds that will determine when everyone carries out their moves. However, the game rewards you for attacking earlier.

If you manage to hit an enemy before they do their action, you will crit them, which on top of extra damage can come with other bonuses like stuns, or armor breaks, depending on what attack you used.

On top of that, you can push their action further down the timeline, which then gives ANOTHER one of your characters an opportunity to crit them, and possibly even push them further down the timeline.

Enemies build up a resistance to being pushed at some point, but if you manage to use the right attacks to push them far enough before that happens, you will ""break"" them, which means their turn will be skipped until next round.

This allows for such fun and strategic play. Attacks can be devastating in this game, especially from bosses or larger groups, so pushing enemies down the timeline can save your characters one round, while you quickly regen your shields or prepare a strong attack for next round.

There are a ton of status effects, weaknesses and strengths that different enemies have, and you can see it all when you inspect them. 

In between combat, you are plopped into an overworld with randomly generated encounters. You can only visit a handful of them per day, so you need to plan your route efficiently. Some tiles might have loot, while others may have a strong mini-boss.

Killing enemies rewards you with DNA that you can upgrade your characters with. They get base stat increases, while allowing them to equip higher end gear, and earning them new moves or cards to use during camps.

Setting up a camp is what you do once you've depleted your moves for the day. Your characters sit around the fire, and prepare for the next day.

Here, you can use character cards on their companions. This can sometimes heal them, or give them buffs for the next battle. On top of that, it'll increase the relationship points between the two characters. As that happens, they earn permanent buffs, gain a combined attack, or even unlock a new progeny character for you to use.

Once you're done with the camp segment, you play out 2 more days before you have to fight the big bad boss for that specific planet.

Bosses come with randomized traits, including things like weaknesses to specific attacks, or becoming enraged if you break their armor, for example.

After you've completed one planet, you have a brief respite where you can use earned credits to purchase equipment from the store, and get to recruit new characters to your squad.

And that's the basic rhythm of the game.

Although there isn't a huge focus on story, it's present, and characters chatter all the time. Most of it is jokey, and got a chuckle out of me, while sometimes they sprinkle a bit of lore.

The main premise is that the bad guys are going from dimension to dimension, wiping out everyone. If you succeed or fail a run, your next run will take place in the next dimension in the crosshairs of the evil imperium.

As for the aesthetic, it speaks for itself, but it truly gorgeous. The pixel art is awesome, but the lighting is really what seals the deal. It makes everything pop out and just look stunning. The sound adds ""oomph"" too, with satisfying attacks sounding explosive.

Finally, the music is incredibly catchy and helps accompany the atmosphere.

Overall, I love the game. My only real issue is that UI can be a pain sometimes. Seeing enemy effects isn't as easy as it should be, being hidden behind two button presses, but that stops being a problem after you've learned the symbols more or less.

The rest of the game is very well  crafted though. The gameplay is satisfying, and discovering new characters is exciting. 
I highly recommend it!

Summarized version below![/h1][/quote]
If you’ve ever wanted a roguelite Octopath tactical RPG, then you’ve probably come to the right place because Star Renegades is pretty much exactly that. As a fan of all of those genres (and as someone that somehow finds himself reviewing a new roguelite every couple weeks), of course I’m gonna check it out.

[h2]Graphics, Music, & Optimization:[/h2]
As the visuals are a huge part of this game, I’m gonna start there. If you’ve ever played Octopath Traveler, the aesthetic is very similar. The world is in 3D, but all of the actual assets are sprites and done entirely in 2D. It makes for this very interesting contrast, which is furthered by the game’s heavy use of lighting, particle effects, and general ambience like trees and grass swaying in the background. Unlike Octopath though, the sprites are generally larger and with more fine detail. And of course, this is all done with a very sci-fi look and with some good optimization too. I had no issues running the game maxed out at 1440p and 155 fps on my 1070 Ti.

Then you got the animation, which the game does a really good job at. It’s already pretty good on the world map, but once you’re in a battle, it becomes very clear that the devs wanted the fights and characters to be as flashy as possible. Bright colors, lots of sprite ghosting, it’s quite the spectacle. I can see some having an issue with just how in-your-face everything is, but I thought it was pretty neat. The music, on the other hand, I didn’t really enjoy all that much, especially with how repetitive it felt. This ended up being one of those games where I would just listen to my own music.

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]
Now onto the topic of the actual gameplay, I believe it is important to set expectations here. Although the game has the JRPG tag, the vast majority of your time (like 90% of it) is going to be spent in combat. There is a game world that you walk around, but it acts more like a hub than something to actually explore. It’s broken up into sections and you have a limited amount of movements to make per in-game day, at which point some of the map gets locked out to you and you’re forced to sleep to reset the counter and continue your journey. It’s kinda similar to FTL in this regard, but with a much fancier-looking map.

[h2]Combat:[/h2]
Now I won’t deny that I was a bit disappointed by that aspect of the game, but that’s where the combat comes in to make up for it. And when I say make up for it, it really does, this is honestly some of the best turn-based combat I have ever seen in a roguelite. It plays a lot like a modern JRPG, with an action timeline determining when characters can get their move dependent on what action they take. You’re able to abuse this timeline too, including the ability to delay enemy attacks by attacking before them or even outright staggering them into the next round, although the game does place a hard limit on how often you’re able to do this before an enemy ignores it.

That’s just scratching the surface though, there is a ton of depth to the combat here. You’ve got the multitude of different attack types, tons of buffs and debuffs to apply, combos that can be done between party members, and a card system that allows you to apply upgrades and passive abilities before you even enter combat. Honestly, it felt like I was playing a strategy game with just how complex it was, and that’s before you consider the countless combos you can form by matching up different classes and items equipped on each. There are 13 unique classes to choose from that you unlock over the course of the game and I had a lot of fun experimenting with different setups and trying to find that optimal combo.

[h2]Difficulty:[/h2]
And you’ll want to find that combo, as the combat in this game can be outright brutal at times. I thought I was doing pretty good on my first run only to get absolutely shredded by the second boss after spending a couple hours in that run. It took me four runs to finally get through that boss, only to then reach the third and get shredded there instead. It can definitely seem unfair at times, especially when a boss has damage reflect or is able to attack twice in one turn, but that’s just the kind of difficulty the game goes for.

[h2]Roguelite Mechanics:[/h2]
As the game is a roguelite, you have to restart the entire thing from the beginning every time you die, but there is a sense of progression in that you unlock new upgrades, weapons, and classes each time. The runs are longer than what I’m used to from the genre (around 2-3 hours), but with each run I found myself getting closer and closer to that final area and it never felt like I was just outright stuck.

[h2]UI:[/h2]
Now before I close this out, I gotta mention the UI. Although I am fine with how flashy the combat is, the UI doesn’t really make things easier. There are tons of icons, numbers, and other elements all over the place and it’s honestly hard to keep track of everything. This is especially noticeable when a unit has like 10 buffs on them and the UI elements cover a good third of the screen. Some tooltips would have been very helpful in alleviating this issue, but honestly, the game could just use an overall UI rework instead.

[h2]Overall:[/h2]
Overall though, Star Renegades is still a very fun game. It looks fantastic, has a ton of room for experimentation, and has some of the best turn-based combat I’ve seen from this genre. I had a blast trying out different party setups, optimizing each character’s loadout, and finally taking down those tough bosses. The game could use improvements in some areas (most notably with its UI), but it’s a fun experience regardless and one I would recommend if you’re into turn-based RPGs.

Star Renegades is a cool turn-based roguelike that has a lot to offer. It’s a polished title that wears its inspirations on its sleeves and delivers a well crafted gameplay experience from beginning to end. The sharp blend of luck, skill, and perseverance needed to beat the game as well as the superb presentation kept me coming back again and again. Each playthrough rewards the player with subtle improvements along with a greater familiarity with how each character functions on a mechanical level.
